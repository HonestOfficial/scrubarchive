The Minecraft Subscriber event will start at 5 o’clock CST. They’re will be two separate events to give a fair opportunity to play at your strengths! Each event will give special loot to everyone who participates and a special unique item to the winner of each event! Events will be posted a couple hours ahead of the stream to give you guys some time to think. At the end of both events we will be holding a giveaway of 50$ to only subscribers! You do not need to play on the Minecraft server to be entered into the giveaway!! @everyone

The first event will be a build off in creative mode. Everyone that is participating will be in creative mode and will have to build a “spooky” house/tower/pumpkin whatever you want, I will be judging creativity and how the build looks! Special prize for the winner. And yes participation trophy’s for the losers.             The second event will be a survival of the fittest where all participants will be enclosed in the arena and mobs will be spawning all around. Last one alive wins. A prize will be awarded to the winner.  Then the 50$ giveaway will commence! @everyone

Minecraft Event:           We will be holding another event for everyone on the server! Over a 7 day period ( October 30th - November 6th ) you will be tasked with making the best looking/functioning base. 1st/2nd/3rd will all be awarded! You must build at least 300 blocks away from spawn, if you already started your base you can continue building onto it. Me and the rest of the staff will be judging based on how cosmetically pleasing your build is and also how many functions it has; Xp farm, food source, storage area, etc. Get to building block heads! (Suggested by NiaBug) @everyone

Hey, @everyone No stream today. I think I will be officially moving my off day to Wednesday and be streaming on Sunday.  I also want to let everyone know that Friday 8:00 AM CST we will be doing a huge server test, we will be stress testing a new server just to see how it runs with everyone on. Now everyone that participates will be receiving some kind of in game reward and I will be holding a giveaway right after the stress testing. I know that 8 AM is extremely early for my stream but its the only time that I can do this, so please come! I will be releasing more details after the stress test on our plans. Thank you all and never forget you are the bomb dot com, Swiggity Swaggity, The REAL BEEZ NEEZ!! ❤️

[11-Dec-19 12:19 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Through this weird transition period of switching servers possibly and the new minecraft update all of your inventory's are wiped. This is due to me not backing things up properly. I do not know the future of where the server is going, I know that we are talking to another server provider that shows a lot of hope but it comes with some negatives as well. For this I am sorry because your in game experience is not a reliable one from day to day. I ask for you guys to try to hang in there, while I get this sorted out. If not I understand, please direct any complaints or issues directly to me. @everyone 

Thank you for your patience.

Hello @everyone 
We are officially sponsored with Server.Pro!! Now listen with this great news comes some bad news, as you guys know we have been dealing with a lot of server issues in the past couple weeks, me and the whole staff have been working our ass's off to bring you guys the best experience possible. So tomorrow at 12 PM cst we are bringing you guys not only a new server but a new world. 

A lot has changed from the old the server, we ran into a lot of balancing issues and exploits but I think we have it as close as possible to success! I will be bringing a list of changes to the server that a lot of you are not going to love and lot of you will. Know that in the long run we are trying to give the community the best experience possible. 
Love MrScrub.

Hey @everyone 
Today on stream we are going to make a community subway station! Anyone is able to help us out, we are going to need a lot of iron / gold / redstone and building materials. 

Definition of subway station: an underground electric railroad

Please note the underground part, we do not want this to scare our world so let’s decorate tunnels that lead to everyone’s base. We will have a central subway that you can setup to lead to your base and then from there at your home you can setup rails leading to other significant builds you have. 

At the moment tpa and sethomes will stay the same, hopefully this can help bridge that gap that we all are having! 
Please note as well this will take a lot of time and resources, this is why we play the game though.

Later today we are gunna play the Witcher, before we get into it. The game is rated 17+ and has nudity in parts of the game. I have already confirmed I can play the game on twitch. Just fair warning for anyone who might not want to see that kind of content. The story is amazing and it’s mainly questing and combat. We will be starting with Minecraft though.

Hello @everyone 
Starting now, you will have 5 days to create the best base on the server!! That’s right, me and a couple others will be judging your base again! Remember big points for functionality and cosmetics. 
We will have first, second, and third prizes! You will have to be in the stream on December 27th for your base to be judged. 

Note: We have enabled the new builder rank so we will be looking very closely to see who might be deserving of such rank!
Last time we did this it was the most unique bases that won the competition:
1st: Custom biome -CSI
2nd: Floating island -Owl
3rd: Lore based mine shaft -Sharpzi

Super excited to see what you guys have to offer in the next 5 days!

Hey @everyone 

Starting early next week (possibly Monday) we are starting up a new server modded server! Now before anyone gets concerned, our current vanilla server is still going to be live 24/7. 
Currently the only way to have access to the new server is going to be being a tier 2 subscriber. I do apologize to a lot of you out there that can not afford that but we can’t have a ton of people on the modded server and expect it to run as good as the community vanilla server. In the future I will look into more ways to help you guys get in the server!! 

I hope you guys have a great Sunday!! I will not be streaming because of the football games!  Go pack Go! 🧀 🏈 🧀

Howdy @everyone 

Today we are starting our second server, sadly it is a premium server at the moment and you will have to be a tier 2 subscriber to play on it. I also want everyone to test out the mod pack on single player before playing with us to ensure it runs well on your computer! 

Stream is going to be delayed 1 hour to give me just a little bit more time for setting up the server, my apologies but I want everything to run as smoothly as possible!

Thank you guys so much for all of the support and love, I am super excited to setup this second server for our community!! :mrscru3Bomb: 🎉😁

Guys my internet is still not working up to par. I had a tech come out and he has no idea why. I've been calling all day long and can't get a hold of my provider. I have no idea what I can do, I apologize for this and hopefully I can get it figured out.
Thank you for your patience.

UPDATE:
Still having internet issues. Second tech guy currently at my house. Says he’s going to call maintenance and they will need to go up and fix the node on the pole. Supposedly, voltage is back feeding into the upload line and this is causing a such a huge impact into my upload speed. 
All that being said he said it could take anywhere between 24-48 hours before they come and fix it. I will keep you all updated to the best of my ability. 
I love you all! Tonight we should all hop in a Vc and just chat! @everyone

@everyone 

Going to try a new stream schedule starting tomorrow!

1st stream: 8am - 12pm
2nd stream: 4pm - 8pm

So the plan is to do 2 streams a day with a 4 hour gap in between to do some chores, eat, ect. 

Obviously some days we might go longer, especially on the weekends but this makes it a little easier on me rather then sitting for 8 hours straight.

Hey,
@everyone 

Just wanted to send this out to update you on me. I am not so great at the moment, I’ve been really stressed and tbh don’t feel like streaming in the slightest. 

I feel like I’m finally getting over my cold, but I haven’t been able to get my migraine medicine so I’ve been suffering through some bad withdrawals of late. With my grandpa in a critical state my mom has been practically living at the hospital so I’ve been taking care of her dog and driving over to her house 3-4 times a day. I’ve been pushing people that I care about away from me instead of using them as a stress relief. My sleep schedule is completely ruined once again and I miss the sun. ☀️ 

I just wanted to let you all know why I am not streaming on the normal schedule and want to insure you that I will be back hopefully tomorrow. 

You guys mean so much to me, the fact that you watch some average guy play video games is sometimes unbelievable to me. 

I love you all and hope to see y’all soon!

Many Apologies @everyone 

The survival world is going to be reset.

On the new server we will have multiple worlds for different gamemodes.
- Survival (towny) Server
- Creative World
- Prison Server (Coming Soon)
And many more things in the future.

I will not be streaming today, for we are working endlessly to get everything up and running.
A Server Trailer will be out later this week.
We are aiming for the server start date to be Friday April 3th.

Quick disclaimer as well.. all ranks have been reset so please make a ticket when you notice your rank is gone. It’s a new permission setup so at the moment our devs will have to maintain it until I learn.

So today I saw my grandpa for the final time. He passed shortly after I left..

He was a great man who loved his family, he drank miller highlife, and loved to gamble. He lived his remaining 20 years of his life in Florida and in a cabin in northern Wisconsin, retired and enjoying his time with family and friends. 
Thank you all for reading this, it means the world to me and for being so supportive <3

Hello @everyone 

My basement completely flooded because of the storms that rolled on through the last couple of days.

This means that all my pc stuff and what not had to be moved, as I clean everything up. Tbh don’t expect a stream today, I might do a test stream to make sure everything is setup properly later. But we will have to see...

When it rains, it poors!!
Love you all!!!

We now have a Spawner Island! An Island for you to get all the spawners you could possibly desire!
Also the sub system should be back and working so make sure you follow the steps in the #sub-vip-roles to gain your sub role!

Hello @everyone 

I just got my new stream layout all ready to go. It looks absolutely amazing. I recommend anyone to go to this discord (https://discord.gg/3QcsqpY) if they are looking for a new stream layout or anything in that nature.

I paid a extremely fantastic price and it only took 3 days. 

Here is a sneak peek! ❤️

Hey @everyone 

Just a heads up, I won’t be streaming today.

I have spent all day painting and getting frustrated... haha 😂 

I still haven’t even slept, bout to go hit the hay after a long long day. Hopefully tomorrow we will have everything done.

Btw tenant, the movie I watched today was really good. 
Super confusing and makes you think a lot.

I am definitely going to need to watch it 2-3 times to understand everything. It reminds me a lot of inception. 

Ok I must sleep! Night y’all! ❤️❤️❤️

Hey guys! 

Hope @everyone is ok! 

My mom went through surgery today and they gave her a complete hysterectomy. And turns out she didn’t have ovarian cancer.

But still just because of the scare I would still like to do our 24 hour charity event on October 30th-31st for ovarian cancer. 

Many woman suffer from ovarian cancer and they lose the ability to have kids if they have to take everything out. So all the money we raise will go to that, trying to prevent it and hopefully finding a cure one day!

Thank you all for taking the time to read this and I will see you guys tomorrow!! ❤️

So no tattoo for me today. 

She was putting the design on me and I wasn’t liking how it was turning out, so after a couple hours she’s going to work more on it and hopefully we can get it perfect!

But sadly I’m going to have to wait!
