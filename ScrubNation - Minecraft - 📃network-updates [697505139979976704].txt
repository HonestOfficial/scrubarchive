(Theres are entitled to be changed) * Updated 8:30am

just use /cp for protection!
Each protection cost $5

All your commands are under /help (This info is under towny section)

Remember to report all bugs to @deleted-role


[13-Apr-20 02:46 PM] Litt#9053

Wont auto-lock placeables. You have to type /lock to enable lock mode

It cost $5.00 per protection.

@everyone

**Towny**:

Fixed weird bug where you can't use /warp shop


[14-Apr-20 03:37 AM] Litt#9053
**Towny**:

Just wanted to go over the new Protection system...

I turned **off** auto protect, so you have to manually protect your containers/entities.

That will be done with */lock* and then right click what you want protected.

If you accidently use */lock* just type it again and it will close out.

**Defaults** get 6 locks
**Subs** get 20 locks
**Vip** gets 35 locks

First lock is $5 then it goes up each time by 2% each lock

View all settings relating to your protections with */cp*

Let me know if theres **any** issues!


[16-Apr-20 09:35 AM] Litt#9053

```
- Mined blocks will now automatically go into your inventory
- Fortune now works on more blocks

Today we had some unfortunate events occur. There is an exploit to where players who use hacked clients that can take advantage of offline servers. To run a bungee server we had to have certain settings on... This allowed these players to join and connect using Mortex's Minecraft account. Towny server spawn was only thing really affected. We have now fixed everything they have affected. 

As soon as I got on, I was reached out by the CEO of SparkedHost (Our server hosting company) Who immediately realized something was wrong reached out and immediately helped us come to fixes. We've also installed two special plugins to prevent this exploit and several exploits to ever happen.

We will be installing the rest of the protection for Creative and Prison server so they will be down tell tomorrow.

We are doing finishing touches to Towny and it will be back up.

Thank you for all your patience and support!

@everyone


[20-Apr-20 02:21 AM] Litt#9053

Hello @everyone ,
Well last night/This Morning was unexpected wasent it 🧐.
Here's a quick update to the servers.

```
- VPN/Proxy can NOT be used and the network will reject you.
- Exploit fixer to prevent such attacks as UUID Spoof, Custom Payloads, Server crash and more .
-  Handshake Protocol Verify.
-  Anti-Bot (Prevent Bot Attacks.)
- MCStaff will have to enter there own PIN to identify it's them playing.
- Client Identify.
```

I can't promise you lot that the new stuff added is 100% reliable but should work as expected.

If you do decide to leave and wanting to come back later you can but at the moment the play.scrub.network is temp down! Some people can still connect to it fine but this may not be the case. Sorry for an issues~~

**Its about time...**

A couple of us have been *trapped*  here for awhile now. It's definitely *a lot* better then the last place they had me in...
Each *place* they send me seems to have *new* blocks and ores for me to *mine*...

I guess its fair...

My small plot allows me to farm my *food* and build a shelter which i've been *upgrading* with each place **they** send me...
I've even started a *collection* of *contraband* which **they** don't know about.

Even my *tools* have been upgrading, it does seem like **they** control this.

I do have *optimism* that there is an *end*  to this and I will be *liberated*...
I don't know how many other *prisoners* I can fight off either...



*** Coming May 1st, 2020...***

**Strange things have been happening**...

The few of us that have scaled through these *different* and *strange* "mines" have exchanged stories lately...

Stories of being *followed*...

Late at night we've been seeing *lights* in the *sky*...

The **Warden** has called us crazy and *threatens* to send us to *psych* ward.

Each night I *swear* the lights are getting closer.
I  *believe* i'm being watched when i'm at my plot. Not by the **Warden** either.

I do not **feel** safe.

It's been *awhile*...

I perfectly adjusted to the life inside the Mines...

Things weren't horrible... I just finished setting up my base at the plot, and a great supply of food for my daily lunches at the mines.

but *all* that *has* changed.

Now i'm just captive on *whatever* this is. 

All I can see is endless *Darkness* and these tiny lights

I don't even know how I am *alive* I haven't had a taste of food or even a sip of water since my *abduction*

All I hear is *weird* noises, I hope I survive...

This is temporary, and purely so you guys can have some extra entertainment while we work on some things.

Staff will not be fixing any bugs, or resolving any tickets specifically pertaining to the Prison server right now.
The server is filled with bugs and exploits. However it is still fun and functional. Enjoy it for what it is. Amazing things are coming.

**Welcome to Hardcore**!

Couple things...

First off; If you are a sub/vip, please make a Ticket for your role. This server uses separate permissions, sorry about that.
I'll be as quick as possible to adding roles.

*Server features*:

```- Grief Prevention is back! Use a golden shovel to claim your base! You start off with 200 claim blocks and grow 100 claims blocks per hour.
- Same chest protection as towny!
- If you are a sub you have access to /kit sub
- If you are a vip you have access to /kit vip```

Do not make tickets with your death ban. You will not be unbanned. Death bans are final.

Have fun and please report bugs in #📩tickets!

Cya guys soon!
Official release of server is as soon as scrub streams!


[06-Jul-20 02:34 AM] Litt#9053

**Hardcore:**

__Patch Notes:__
```- Increased mob spawn rate
- Added new sleep mechanic```

__Sleeping:__
```- When you go to sleep at night, it slowly progresses the "in game time".
- Time will progress faster, the more players that sleep.
- When sleeping for long periods of time you may receive up to a half heart of health.```
