What's the best Headset people recommend?


[31-Jul-19 07:57 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I use astro A40's , I really like them but if you wanna go for super high end (god like hearing) go with a headset from Audio Technica.


[31-Jul-19 07:59 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Thanks I shall have a look :), I'm also looking at the PLANTRONICS RIG 800 HS which seem pretty good too


[31-Jul-19 08:09 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yea, personally haven‚Äôt had any experience with them but I‚Äôve heard good things

@Irish Destiny seriously sorry for not streaming last couple days! Not been feeling cod and playing other games on stream doesn‚Äôt always seem like the best thing. Will be back tomorrow though!

{Reactions}
üëÄ 

[19-Aug-19 07:56 AM] ssheadon#9033
Are you sure about that


[19-Aug-19 01:04 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Stream might be a little late tonight guys, we bought new couches today so when I get out of work I‚Äôll be busy hauling them in and the old ones out. But I will be on, probably a little of cod tonight and a little of Madden!


[19-Aug-19 01:06 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Also heads up tomorrow I think we will be playing a whole new game entirely called ‚ÄúRemnant: From the Ashes‚Äù


[19-Aug-19 01:06 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
We will be running mostly cod after Tuesday though with the AEC tournament happening this coming Saturday.


[23-Aug-19 08:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
How is everyone liking the cod alpha so far? I‚Äôm a huge fan of how the game feels and the guns just feel amazing! The only thing I‚Äôm hesitant on is that the utilities feel weak compared to black out but that might not even be a bad thing.


[23-Aug-19 08:32 AM] Cartplayz#0138
Its trash, stop.


[23-Aug-19 09:14 AM] Irish Destiny#8219
Haven‚Äôt played but watching your last night stream now. I‚Äôm liking it a lot from the looks of it!


[23-Aug-19 09:33 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I played a lot off stream late last night and the deagle is absolutely my favorite weapon

[23-Aug-19 09:43 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
At first wasent keen on it but now changed my mind


[23-Aug-19 09:46 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Graphics also looks dope, but i bare wanna see actual gameplay in 4K with RTX on


[23-Aug-19 09:51 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Also with the new engine im surprised they havent implemented a destruction mechanic but yet again i guess they dont want people to think they copying battlefield


[23-Aug-19 10:46 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yea I‚Äôve had a hard time finding many complaints about it so far, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a little destruction like in rainbow 6! But at times it doesn‚Äôt feel like cod, and I‚Äôm happy about that. They‚Äôre adding 2 more maps throughout the weekend


[23-Aug-19 05:36 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Some peoplesaying on twitter the game is runnung at the range of 30-60 FPS but haven't really noticed?  Has abyone seen frames drops or spikes?

Its like blackout.. Where you start with no guns and you have to run around finding weapons and basically first to kill the whole team wins.

Just wondering when are you planning to stream next ü§ôüèº


[02-Sep-19 06:21 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Hey, @Mortexüá¨üáß everything is ok and going great. Actually I‚Äôve been doing some stream improvements the last couple days and was planning on jumping on stream tonight! Should still be able to for a little bit but I have to finish a couple things before hand, you can expect the stream to be live in about an hour from now. (:


[02-Sep-19 08:05 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Sorry guys, really wanted to get a stream going today. We were just dropping to many frames. Going to need to call the internet provider. Hopefully we can have a "re" grand reveal of our new stream set up! lmao. Tomorrow 5 Pm Central time be there or be square.

No your correct


[14-Sep-19 01:54 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I really like it, it‚Äôs just the fact that it‚Äôs not the same? So what the reason why I don‚Äôt play the old modern warfare games is because I‚Äôm sick of them, I‚Äôm already 30 days+ in them. I don‚Äôt want the same games over and over and over


[14-Sep-19 01:54 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Its not the same but you gotta relive the modern warfare name

Most games mechanism are based off other games though, like there's nothing fresh nowadays, like BR that was fresh till COD, apex and other BR games stole the idea from fortnite.


[19-Sep-19 12:58 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yea but that‚Äôs ok in my mind, they do make innovations in games but they need eachother to keep improving. I mean if h1z1 was the only BR then it would be a sad sad day...


[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
I played h1z1 on ps4 and I'm not a huge fan of it.


[19-Sep-19 01:01 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Like in my opinion when they first released the game it looked like it was imported from ps2

No it's fine, it's not my server, I expected it to change at some point


[18-Oct-19 06:34 PM] that_thing_you_like#4474

[19-Oct-19 09:33 PM] courtdadork#3563
Scrub has to whitelist you first


[19-Oct-19 09:33 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Or me


[19-Oct-19 09:33 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

maybe he spelt my ign wrong '~'

[19-Oct-19 09:34 PM] acethetix#2020
iida_big_brain heheh


[20-Oct-19 02:50 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
You should add a command in the discord and twitch that whitelists yourself


[20-Oct-19 02:52 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
That would be very clever, would we need a plugin to link to twitch?


[20-Oct-19 02:53 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Sure just make one unless one doesn't already exist


[20-Oct-19 02:53 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I definitely don‚Äôt know how to do such a thing


[20-Oct-19 02:53 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Maybe Mortex knows how, or I could help *wink*


[20-Oct-19 02:54 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
That's what I wanted to talk to you about yesterday ‚òú(Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü‚òú)


[20-Oct-19 02:56 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Haha could you set it up to link subs to certain roles as well?


[20-Oct-19 02:56 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Yeah, I thought you guys already had that? *wait never mind I remember now*


[20-Oct-19 02:57 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
No, the roles would have to be manually switched. We couldn‚Äôt find a plugin that would do it for us


[20-Oct-19 02:57 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Sounds like you need someone to make a custom one *wink* *wink*


[20-Oct-19 02:57 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I mean if some would could that would be amazing üòâ


[20-Oct-19 02:58 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Maybe I could help (‚äô_‚äô;)


[20-Oct-19 02:59 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Haha how tough is something like that to setup? It seems like it would be quite complicated


[20-Oct-19 03:02 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
Taking information from a website is a bit difficult other than that it‚Äôs pretty simple


[20-Oct-19 03:03 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
You must have some kinda background in these things huh?


[20-Oct-19 03:03 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
A bit, but I haven‚Äôt used Java in 3 years so i‚Äôm gonna need a big refresher


[20-Oct-19 03:06 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Well I wish I could be of help. I have learned that i am not very good with computers like I once thought.


[20-Oct-19 03:07 AM] Bluepenguin#1477
I actually will need your help since i‚Äôm not the operator and you‚Äôll be the one that actually implements it not me. Plus you‚Äôre better than you think you are


[20-Oct-19 03:08 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Well that is something I would love to implement. Let‚Äôs talk more about it tomorrow? I need to get some sleep, way past my bed time (:

[20-Oct-19 08:28 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
What i meant with cba is.

Like you ask people not do certian things and yet they do the opposite it makes me not wanna put effort in.

It happens! It‚Äôs not like me and Courtney don‚Äôt get into fights or rough patches! Sometimes I hate her guts (; but she‚Äôs the woman I love and I will be with her forever. I hated my mom sometimes too! It seems like you guys are together for a reason and you need to talk! And that stuff doesn‚Äôt get fixed in a day but it‚Äôs a start! Try to be extra kind and you‚Äôll see the same in return. If not maybe it‚Äôs not you!

It's been going on and off for four years, started with cheating and then guys send nudes to my partner, which made me paranoid and not trust any guy that talks to my partner. I could go into more but don't think I wanna publicly say it so people can thinking of me as a cunt aswell.


[22-Oct-19 09:53 AM] secretajnz#0554
If it makes you feel better I will always think of you as a nice person I think most people will most people have been down the same road!

Jealousy is normal especially when their were instances unfaithfulness, but you need to tell her how you feel. Trust is everything in a relationship.

Sorry everyone, I said I would stream some modern warfare tonight but I just got home from the haunted house, I drove over 120 miles today and it was pouring during the haunted house so I got soaked, but I still had a great time hanging out with court and her 2 friends! We sat in a Culver‚Äôs for over 2 hours and just chatted so I had a pretty good time! Might do some gaming tomorrow, I‚Äôll let y‚Äôall know! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Before i start i love helping out the stream and sever but I'm not sure if this something i want to do permanently or temporary but I'm thinking of stepping down from being a mod and helping out on the server (in-game wise), due to reasons that i dont fell like discussing, it's not based on real life problem's, but things I've came across or noticed over a period of time, some people may know why I've been acting weird lately and others don't. But all im saying since meeting scrub first time on twitch he is an amazing guy and i shall not stop supporting the scrubnation community even if i did back down from my roles as it feels like a family.

Why not allow access to /tpahere for plebs and subs, or at least just subs?

He wants people to use the cords and walk instead of cheating to the location.

True, so be honest with her and yourself. Don‚Äôt say something you don‚Äôt mean. And prove what you say is what you mean. Also don‚Äôt beat yourself down, keep trying

Sometimes being with someone for so long like 4 years, it‚Äôs hard to know or show that you love someone but I‚Äôm sure you will find a way that you love her

Ok. Current issue?


[21-Nov-19 09:36 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
So due to OVh Custom Kernel for linux it forbids somethings bing installed


[21-Nov-19 09:36 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
we was also running windows 2019


[21-Nov-19 09:37 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
But everytime i ran standalone installer for multicraft or via cpanel or plesk, It would return a YII Framework error

Yii


[21-Nov-19 09:39 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Everytime i changed PHP Version as well it would return a http error 500

thinking of using esxi


[21-Nov-19 09:42 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
but i dont wanna share cores


[21-Nov-19 09:42 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
and plus he only has one static IP


[21-Nov-19 09:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just do esxi and then put most cores to a vm win 10


[21-Nov-19 09:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
And treat it as 1 machine


[21-Nov-19 09:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
You lose a little resources but you get it working


[21-Nov-19 09:44 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
but you would need about 2 IPs.. one to access esxi panel and anther ip to dedicated to the win vm + multicraft panel

@ScrubDetector so remember the stream overlay I said I was making for you? I ran into multiple issues üòÖ


[28-Nov-19 04:00 PM] MatthewTGM#4058
I dont really know what you like, so I had problems with the background, I also didnt know if you wanted an onscreen chat box and a seperate alertbox or if you want it overlappibg something... Yeeeaaaah


[28-Nov-19 04:01 PM] MatthewTGM#4058
Also, im rlly bored so I was wondering if you wanted a custom resource pack, I was waiting for a chance to make a fully fledged resource pack at some point but never had a reason to


[28-Nov-19 04:07 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
You know I really dont need a overlay right now. It would be cool if you could make a custom resource pack! I really like faithful but if you could customize it to be more on scrub nation and what not would be awesome


[28-Nov-19 04:13 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

[03-Dec-19 06:15 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Whats your net speed?


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Play.Scrub.Network is the address


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Pinkish#0001
Ok


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Pinkish#0001
Then actually idk


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
My net speed is probably stupid slow, this internet is straight trash


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Pinkish#0001
If other severs work and only his doesn't


[03-Dec-19 06:16 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Depends on server location


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Pinkish#0001
This is US based right?


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
But why  had it never given me  a problem until now?


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Pinkish#0001
If he logs in and out in the same tick it's not lag usually


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Yeah, Southern US


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Remember if not all packets get fully transmitted to the server it will cause to timeout


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Show us your speed test


[03-Dec-19 06:17 PM] Pinkish#0001
Just google speed test


[03-Dec-19 06:18 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Doing it right now


[03-Dec-19 06:18 PM] Pinkish#0001
If you have anything above 5Mb/s download you should be able to get in

Better upgrade to fibre


[03-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Pinkish#0001
OOF


[03-Dec-19 06:19 PM] Pinkish#0001
Well I think we found the problem


[03-Dec-19 06:19 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
We can't, they don't have fiber on this side of the city

[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I'll be in New Orleans full time here in a few weeks, should have fire internet then


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Pinkish#0001
Any internet retailer all over the US usually say they can give you 60MB/s download, I would contact your ISP if that's all your getting


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Pinkish#0001
Cause that's literally less than 1% of what you should be getting


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I have, they said t here's nothing they can do


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
How much is your net?

How much do u pay?


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
It better be free


[03-Dec-19 06:20 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
and who are you with ?


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I don't pay anything, my roommate pays for internet


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
Still


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Pinkish#0001
It doesn't even matter if you live in the middle of nowhere, you can get satellite internet in the middle of the woods and still get a subtle 20mb/s download


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
He pays $40 a month. I refused to pay a goddamn dime


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
That's not penny worthy connection

[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
$40 brv


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Pinkish#0001
Yeah that's nothing


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
That's a fucking rip off


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
you can get like 150mbps for $40


[03-Dec-19 06:21 PM] Pinkish#0001
I would check out other ISP retailers in your area


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I used to have Comcast, but I switch to his after he moved in because it was cheaper. Regretted it every day since then


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Pinkish#0001
Ah, if you're in an area with ComCast is there Cox in your area?


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I'll only be in Mississippi for a few more weeks


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Pinkish#0001
Cox was great


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
cheaper = shitter speed


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
@Pinkish I don't think so


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Pinkish#0001
No Cox?


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] Pinkish#0001
You can't only have 1 wired ISP in your town that would be a monopoly


[03-Dec-19 06:22 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
The thing is, they guy I'm moving in with in New Orleans is rich af, so I'm sure his internet is fire af


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Wait you from mississippi ?


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
There's gotta be others


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
Ah


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
@Mortexüá¨üáß Unfortunately


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
Well then you could just wait


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
There's others, my roommate just refuses to switch


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
All towns should have 2 wired ISP's


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
Minimum


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Pinkish#0001
Only buy satellite if the town is too small or you're in the middle of nowhere


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Max speed in your area can get is 55bps


[03-Dec-19 06:23 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I just don't understand how it's always worked fine until today.


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Pinkish#0001
They could be siphoning


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Pinkish#0001
If a line goes down in there town they shrink all download in that area to a fraction of a MB when they do repairs


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Pinkish#0001
That has happened to me


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
It's At&T.


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Pinkish#0001
I've had 0.1mb/s before


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] Pinkish#0001
Because a line went down a few blocks away


[03-Dec-19 06:24 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
It's been like this since we switched six months ago...


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
sounds like dial up üòÑ


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Pinkish#0001
:weirdGa:


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Pinkish#0001
Worse than dial-up


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
It's literally dial up speed! That's what I told him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
He's so fucking stupid, he won't listen


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Pinkish#0001
Is it a locked router? How many people use it?


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Swith to sparklight or xfinity


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Pinkish#0001
How many roommates u got duder?


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Don't know if it's locked, but only two of us use it


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
wtf


[03-Dec-19 06:25 PM] Pinkish#0001
Does he use it all


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
?


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
If he is the owner he can create multiple guest networks that limit speed for other people


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
He can control your download if he's the admin of the router


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Doubt he knows networking stuff


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
He only has  his Ps4 connected. I don't think he uses anything else. The tech guy said we can really only use one device a peice


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
Well still


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
Better bring it up anyway


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
Who knows


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
Cause when family comes here for Thanksgiving


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Does he struggle playing on ps4 ?


[03-Dec-19 06:26 PM] Pinkish#0001
You bet I limit everyone to 5MB/s

[03-Dec-19 06:27 PM] Pinkish#0001
Alright well if he knows nothing I would unplug your router and leave it off for a full minute


[03-Dec-19 06:27 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I literally watch videos in fuckin 360p


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
At best


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] Pinkish#0001
I would reset it honestly


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Streaming is beyond trash


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

What he supposed to be paying for ?


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
It's been reset, they've replaced shit, it's still trash


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] Pinkish#0001
And you're comcast right?


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Xfinity is from comcast?


[03-Dec-19 06:28 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I don't even know what he's supposed to be getting


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I used to have Comcast, this is At&T

Oh


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

They can siphon all the internet they want in your contract


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Spectrum for the win


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I've been fighting him tooth and nail since the day he moved in to switch, but he's too fuckin hard headed


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Xfinity should be able to provide your area up to 200mbps for $69


[03-Dec-19 06:29 PM] Pinkish#0001
AT&T has the most backwards internet contract


[03-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Pinkish#0001
They turn down your speeds just cause they can


[03-Dec-19 06:30 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749

[03-Dec-19 06:30 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
I used to stream to Youtube with my Comcast internet, never once gave me  a problem. Streamed everything in 1080p or better, it was  heaven


[03-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Pinkish#0001
Just not in any major towns


[03-Dec-19 06:30 PM] Pinkish#0001

The server you go on must be much closer to where you live i suppose


[03-Dec-19 06:35 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
It's the server we're supposed to be using, but we switched.


[03-Dec-19 06:35 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
The dedicated server is located in canada


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Pinkish#0001
Ah that explains why I never lag

Virus got me connected to this server while we were making the switch, so I'm in a dedicated server by myself


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Pinkish#0001
I'm 50 miles from the border?


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Pinkish#0001
Wym virus


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
That test server virus has was from withernode which was not located in canada


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Pinkish#0001
Oh a person named that


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
While we were switching to the dedicated server, he told me to join this one, so I'm by myself


[03-Dec-19 06:36 PM] Pinkish#0001
Idk that's strange


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Pinkish#0001
I like a real brain scratcher


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Pinkish#0001
Lemme keep thinking about it


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Pinkish#0001
But your download is def a part of it


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Pinkish#0001
For sure


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Basically if a server is close to him he fine connecting but if a different sever is miles away from him the packets wont b powerfull to send to the server that far away


[03-Dec-19 06:37 PM] Pinkish#0001
With less than a megabyte yeah I can see that


[03-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Pinkish#0001
The question is though *why* is he only getting that


[03-Dec-19 06:38 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749
Guess I'm just shit outta luck


[03-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Upload to the packets to server, server confirms them and download recieves the confirmed packets to let the client know he can procced to join.


[03-Dec-19 06:38 PM] Pinkish#0001
I would just call ISP and be all pissed and ask them why you're at less than a MB download


[03-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Pinkish#0001
Or have your roommate do it


[03-Dec-19 06:39 PM] Pinkish#0001
Anyway I said I was leaving like 5 min ago, I'm out for reals

Hello and Welcome to the stream :D


[03-Dec-19 06:49 PM] Pinkish#0001
I got pinged


[03-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Pinkish#0001
So I'm back


[03-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Yea that was me my bad üòÑ


[03-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Pinkish#0001
Same tho


[03-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Pinkish#0001
I learned about servers in Beta when I knew someone that hosted a public server, I just did all the wetwork at a young age


[03-Dec-19 06:50 PM] Pinkish#0001
Got to learn some java during it


[03-Dec-19 06:51 PM] Pinkish#0001
I wouldn't call myself a pro by any means though I work more with C++ and C# more than anything


[03-Dec-19 06:51 PM] Pinkish#0001
Which has nothing to do with MC


[03-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
I only know some  C#


[03-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Pinkish#0001
It's a good language


[03-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
It is :), normally i used it in creating homebrew/payloads for ps4


[03-Dec-19 06:52 PM] Pinkish#0001
Most discord bots use some version of C, especially if you make your own


[03-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Pinkish#0001
Yo if Scrub ever wants his own bot hmu


[03-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Sure thing


[03-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Pinkish#0001
Might be a fun little side project, the less bots you have that don't reflect the owner look kinda strange


[03-Dec-19 06:53 PM] Pinkish#0001
Would have it's own name & picture


[03-Dec-19 06:54 PM] Pinkish#0001
Okay but fr now I'm REALLY going


[03-Dec-19 11:44 PM] Pinkish#0001
I come back 5 hours later and nothing has happened

[04-Dec-19 12:02 AM] Pinkish#0001
That's not true, do you see how many people play with you


[04-Dec-19 12:06 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Why do you think that is? Because of this community.


[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] SlyGale#5458
Uh i hot hyped after learning that firework loaded crossbow will shoot 3 fireworks if the the crossbow is enchanted with multishot


[04-Dec-19 07:06 AM] SlyGale#5458
And it will only consume one firework


[04-Dec-19 07:07 AM] SlyGale#5458
A single star firework does 2.3 heart dmg and with multishot that's like 6+ hearts


[04-Dec-19 07:08 AM] SlyGale#5458
And a 7 star firework does 9 hearts. O.O

Bukkit, CraftBukkit, Spigot & BungeeCord 1.15
All,

Our software for Minecraft 1.15 has been released for general usage. This is a minor update with few server changes. Accordingly the API changes...

Guys, listen. They are trying their *hardest* to make sure everyone is happy. It‚Äôs really not easy, and I feel like we don‚Äôt show enough support to Scrub and his higher staff. 

Accidents happen, and while backdated inventories are unfortunate, it‚Äôs not the end of the world. I think we need to show scrub how grateful we are that he‚Äôs even given us this platform to play on together.

We all need to appreciate how hard Mortex and Scrub work instead of complaining, they are constantly working their hardest to keep things going and the complaints only slow things down.

I hope that Mortex knows that EVERYONE here cares for him! We appreciate ALL of the work he has done and continues to do. He is one of the most hard working people i have ever seen and it would be a shame for him to leave. We all want the best for the server and right now, and at this very moment, just about every mod is in discord voice chat, working together to find the best solutions for the problems the server has been facing. 
Its easy to feel like the world is against you when everyone is voicing there opinions, because everyone has the best interest of the server at heart. We all need to come together; there is no one person that makes up this server. This is a group effort and, not to speak for everyone, we hope Mortex can be apart of this group again. - the bitch who hasnt been on for ages

Why not just use webhook to notify when he goes live? That why you don't have to worry about bot going offline or anything

That a little bit of a situation


[15-Dec-19 11:46 AM] Sister_Rose#9476
They always go offline  at some point  for small amount  of time to be fix and updated  @Jonathan Ivos#6969 all.bots do


[15-Dec-19 11:51 AM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
Yeah, that's why i said to use webhook since it never (technically) goes offline. Or he could use his own bot, both for twitch and discord, which isn't that hard to set up, and have it online 24/7


[15-Dec-19 11:54 AM] Sister_Rose#9476
Again  @Jonathan Ivos#6969all bot have to go offline times to time in order to be fix and also I know a few owners  of bot

For those interested, for scrub to hit 10,000 followers by the end of the year scrub will need to average 22.86 new followers per day and to stream for 2,500 hours he will need to stream 6.86 hours per day.

Discord recently introduced logging in via QR code, which is pretty handy when the desktop version randomly decides to log you out.
However, as you may have noticed, a small exploit exists, so I'll say this upfront:
NEVER and I mean NEVER scan a QR code for Discord-related gifts or prizes, including Nitro giveaways, through the Discord mobile app, EVER. You are NOT redeeming the "prize", you're giving someone FULL access to your account, regardless of 2FA. Until Discord adds a notice to their app, you'll have to be extremely cautious about this.

Be sure to spread the word to everyone.  you know. This is a serious flaw with Discord's login system, and there's probably a lot of people losing accounts to this scam.

We'll let you know if and when the issue is resolved. Stay safe!

@nathanthescrub Hello, I am sorry to say that the modded server will stay subscriber only at this time, you may access it by subbing for 3 months in a row or by subbing at tier 2 to scrub


[14-Jan-20 12:48 AM] nathanthescrub#1223
i wana join a modded server


[14-Jan-20 12:49 AM] Kai#7346
Then you have to sub for 3 months or sub at tier 2


[14-Jan-20 12:49 AM] Kai#7346
No exceptions


[14-Jan-20 12:49 AM] nathanthescrub#1223
will can you make a server for us


[14-Jan-20 12:50 AM] Kai#7346
No, that would ruin the point of the modded server being for subs

Yes, I‚Äôll change it


[14-Jan-20 07:06 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
@ScrubDetector u can change it to enigmatica light it runs a lot faster on my computer and I have a pretty shitty laptop. It cuts the mods in half, 173 mods I think or something like that. It‚Äôs still pretty good.


[14-Jan-20 07:08 PM] amber#2184

[14-Jan-20 07:35 PM] aryn#3412

[18-Jan-20 07:23 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
I can't manual assign you the role, due to two reasons I can't verify that your a sub via twitch (due to not having manager perms on scrub channel), and i don't have my old role back on here.


[18-Jan-20 07:24 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
If you go to connections in discord settings and add your twitch it will be auto synced to the discord server

Honestly it's a thinkstation since i hate dell.

I have Intel HD graphics so suck on that, squeezy


[23-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Squeezy#7874
And the reason why i run server as operating system is due to windows 10 having issues with updates like broken drivers for example.


[23-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Squeezy#7874
Also intel hd graphics?, Watch until your embedded video card can't play hl2 properly.


[23-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
Any reason to why you hate dell?


[23-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Squeezy#7874
It commonly crashes windows and other devices on laptops for example.


[23-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Squeezy#7874
And battery life is shorter than the others.


[23-Jan-20 02:48 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
Ahh. Never owned any dell products

1 gb down / 1 gb up


[10-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
They do 10gbps


[10-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
up and down


[10-Feb-20 05:41 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
ill take it!


[10-Feb-20 05:46 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
When you discover UK ISP does 50Gbps broadband üòÆ


[10-Feb-20 05:49 PM] Nordic#1337
We got a high end version for "private" use thats 1 GBps, and for big companies we can get speeds up to 100GBps, but the actuall speed in Europe  is waaaaaaay lower


[10-Feb-20 05:49 PM] Nordic#1337
Like Romania has the highest % of Internet in the EU


[10-Feb-20 05:51 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Oof i mean Company's have access to business dedicated lines so they can max out what ever speed they pay for but for the public the max everyone can get is 1gbps, In the UK Companys are starting to slowly roll out 2GBPs, 5GBPS, 10GBPS to the public


[10-Feb-20 06:18 PM] Nordic#1337
Dude NICE


[10-Feb-20 06:18 PM] Nordic#1337
But i bet it cost a fortune


[10-Feb-20 06:19 PM] Nordic#1337
The 1 GBps up here is almost 2500 NOK a month


[10-Feb-20 06:24 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Some companys here are selling for ¬£45


[10-Feb-20 06:24 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Virgin is like nearly ¬£60 - ¬£80 for 1gbps


[10-Feb-20 06:25 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Lowest company for 1gbps is ¬£25 for me üòõ


[10-Feb-20 06:29 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Tokyo has had 2gbps speeds since 2013

[05-Mar-20 05:52 PM] Nordic#1337
"New phone, buy it now"


[05-Mar-20 05:52 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

[05-Mar-20 05:54 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

Found out the UK government might be paying up to 2.5k in wages cause of the virus to workers


[20-Mar-20 06:44 PM] Litt#9053
Ay! Will they be doing recurring too?


[20-Mar-20 06:44 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
It's per a month so I think so


[20-Mar-20 06:44 PM] Litt#9053
We supposedly are getting one in April and another in may or something like that


[20-Mar-20 06:44 PM] Litt#9053
That‚Äôs good!


[20-Mar-20 06:44 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

[20-Mar-20 06:45 PM] Litt#9053
I think we are getting 1-1.5


[20-Mar-20 06:45 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

[20-Mar-20 06:45 PM] Litt#9053
Better then nothing though


[20-Mar-20 06:46 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
But it's only for people who can't work cause of the virus but haven't lost there jobs


[20-Mar-20 06:46 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
:F


[20-Mar-20 06:46 PM] Litt#9053
That‚Äôs weird


[20-Mar-20 06:47 PM] Litt#9053
They‚Äôre doing qualifications based on employment status and how much you make per year. Good for me I was recently laid off and make under 100k a year üòí


[20-Mar-20 06:48 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361

It‚Äôs cause trump is sharing his secrets of how he‚Äôs immune to corona virus

To other government leaders


[20-Mar-20 06:49 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
```Organisations will be able to apply for a grant from HM Revenue and Customs to cover the wages of those who are not working, but haven‚Äôt lost their jobs.```


[20-Mar-20 06:49 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Trump is the key to the vaccine I see.


[20-Mar-20 06:49 PM] Litt#9053
Basically paid absence at work


[20-Mar-20 06:50 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Pretty much


[20-Mar-20 06:50 PM] Litt#9053
Yes. Injecting mass amounts of foreign suda fet makes you immune to corona virus

If you die it‚Äôs part of the game, we even have a plugin that locks your drops so that only you can pick them up. Unfortunately it‚Äôs a part of Minecraft getting killed and losing your stuff. If you have screenshots of a bug or glitch I‚Äôd be happy to help aswell

Is java edition just minecraft on pc?


[26-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
There's two different types of Minecraft versions for PC. : Bedrock (Windows 10 edition) or Minecraft: Java edition. The one you want is the Java edition due to the fact Bedrock Version is very limited to what you can do unlike Java edition

It would be cool to see faces, instead of names for once. I know alot of people are feeling lonely during this time, it would give people a little bit of joy to see/talk to others ya feel

[27-Apr-20 07:39 PM] üéÉJustin AndrewüéÉ#1749

hey just a quick question. If you have the sub role how do you make multiple homes to tp to?

You set multiple homes by using /sethome name, and tp to them by using /home name

@OnlyAPenguin have you finished the seven deadly sins?


[30-Apr-20 11:22 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
@Skarr graves despawn after 2 hours


[30-Apr-20 11:22 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
if u logged for the night then its probably gone


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
no i was about to die and disconected


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
it was morning when i loggged on


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
it shouldn't have registered a death


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
and if it did there should have been a grave


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
theres no way u couldve died unless u logged out it combat or u died before u logged


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
in*


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
i thought about that


[30-Apr-20 11:23 AM] Skarr#9466
i wasn


[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] Skarr#9466

[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
the game doesnt just radomly kill people though


[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] Skarr#9466
i wasn't in combat


[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
maybe a mob hit u bvefore u died?


[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823

[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] Skarr#9466
maybe


[30-Apr-20 11:24 AM] Skarr#9466
still took me too long for all of that


[30-Apr-20 11:25 AM] Skarr#9466
day saw me die and i hope he grabbed it and put it somewhere


[30-Apr-20 11:26 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
thats also possible


[30-Apr-20 11:27 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
and that could be why the grave isnt there


[30-Apr-20 11:27 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
when u loot a grave the grave disapears

I presume you are playing dumb. but if you are that rarded i will explain for you. Its a play on words for a name, like saying your name is "Ben Dover", when you say it its like "Bend over". So the one you did sounds like the 'N-Word' when said.

Please do not talk down to staff. If you think something is a problem please reach out to a staff member or make a ticket. Writing about it in a public chat just further makes drama.

It‚Äôs unnecessary and just mean. 

Thanks guys!

What's prision minecraft btw?


[26-May-20 01:55 PM] Litt#9053
you basically start off with a diamond pick and $0, you level up and go from mine a - z , each mine cost a certain amount of money to go to the next. Each mine has different items.

Everything on the server is under /help its fully customized. 

Like I said though all of our servers are being reworked and will be released in early weeks of June.
Prison server is gonna be amazing, and lots of fun!

As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility
I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me
So I want to take this time out to apologize for things I have done
And things that have not occurred yet
And the things they don't want to take responsibility for.....

Start my job in 2 days anyone have any tips for first impression


[14-Jun-20 05:55 PM] Reyz#8406
Turn off your cellphone. Don‚Äôt be on your cellphone while you wait for the interview.


[14-Jun-20 05:56 PM] daytonagk#0166
I meant for the job not interview


[14-Jun-20 05:56 PM] daytonagk#0166
@Reyz


[14-Jun-20 05:56 PM] Reyz#8406
Well, still turn off your phone. üòõ


[14-Jun-20 05:56 PM] Reyz#8406
Read that wrong.


[14-Jun-20 05:57 PM] daytonagk#0166
Besides the interview it wasn‚Äôt me that had there phone go off it was the person interviewing me that had there phone on and it went off


[14-Jun-20 05:57 PM] Reyz#8406
Be there early. Be willing to learn.  Ask questions.


[14-Jun-20 05:57 PM] Reyz#8406
Find the soda machine.


[14-Jun-20 05:58 PM] daytonagk#0166

[14-Jun-20 05:58 PM] daytonagk#0166
My mom was the person that helped me get into the job


[14-Jun-20 05:58 PM] Reyz#8406
That‚Äôs great! Having connections is one of the easier ways to get a job. It‚Äôs all about connections.


[14-Jun-20 05:58 PM] daytonagk#0166
True


[14-Jun-20 05:59 PM] daytonagk#0166

[14-Jun-20 05:59 PM] daytonagk#0166
I‚Äôm going to be working part time for the 2 weeks I‚Äôll be at my other job then when the 2 weeks are up I‚Äôll be full time


[14-Jun-20 05:59 PM] Reyz#8406
Nice, that‚Äôs awesome!


[14-Jun-20 06:00 PM] Reyz#8406
I‚Äôd say show up early, ask good questions, introduce yourself, take initiative on stuff, smile and relax. Everyone‚Äôs had their first job!


[14-Jun-20 06:01 PM] daytonagk#0166
I‚Äôll always be early because of my mom

If he that champion taught me one lesson well then that would be that you choose yourn own fights and Leuge of Legends is one line of fights that time is beter spent on your acctual live or realy idk minecraft, halo, warframe. For real that not a sport nothing one does means more then on paper and your chances of earning money are better of going stright to walmart. And you can do that just fine or anything else, i just presented you with the easyst choice to mind. Idk I go practise TicTacTo.


[15-Jun-20 02:41 PM] HentaiSlair69#9879
The daru√≠us video is good tho, but don't play the game unironicaly its bad come on i went the whole thing up and down, break it down all you want its a time sink money mashine.

[28-Jun-20 01:52 PM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
Well it was more than just a zipline, it was a whole course


[28-Jun-20 01:52 PM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
Rafting is fun


[28-Jun-20 01:52 PM] Reyz#8406
Tubing is more my speed tho.


[28-Jun-20 01:52 PM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
Agreed


[28-Jun-20 01:53 PM] Reyz#8406
I remember tubing once in Florida and a long snake went across the water. But that was the only scary part. The water was the perfect temperature.

[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] Armando#3380
ok


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] Armando#3380
i opened paysafe website


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] CommunistBean#8354
its basically a receipt with a code that you can enter to a website that supports it


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] CommunistBean#8354
and it should be able to buy bthat game for you


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] Armando#3380
it doesnt have albania


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] Armando#3380

[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] CommunistBean#8354
i dont know if minecraft.net supports it tho


[13-Jul-20 09:28 AM] CommunistBean#8354
yeah wait a sec first


[13-Jul-20 09:29 AM] Armando#3380

[13-Jul-20 09:29 AM] CommunistBean#8354

[13-Jul-20 09:30 AM] CommunistBean#8354
and they dont support paysafe wich is a rip


[13-Jul-20 09:30 AM] CommunistBean#8354

[13-Jul-20 09:31 AM] CommunistBean#8354

What kind of games, and what‚Äôs your budget? @KillerSoulAka


[13-Jul-20 10:30 AM] Shyft üéÉ#0088
Also you should for sure build your pc if you use it for gaming. Prebuilt usually have pretty bad performance and are ***very*** overpriced

@James that‚Äôs what I mean by them being overpriced. You can build it yourself for so much less. And usually you can take the same exact price to built it and use it to buy different parts that are better

Real recognize real. You'll make it with ur interaction and personality. It never seemes like much, but people enjoy watching people do what they love. That's why twitch is so big.

No it‚Äôs bad manner to do that!

Hey guys, 

I‚Äôm canceling the stream today. As many as you guys knew we were fostering a bunny that was thrown out of a car window.. 

Well he was doing so good and we loved him so much and he loved us.. but he has a disease that was untreatable that we found out about today.. 

Kenny has to be put down and I know most of you guys didn‚Äôt know him but he was pretty awesome.. 
@everyone

Yeah we saved a raccoon it was in broad daylight were many many big stray dogs roam but we realized he wouldn't have much time to live so we put him to sleep so he wouldnt suffer anymore


[04-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Piss Baby#9659
Also the dogs are very aggressive so the baby raccoon would've been chewed alive

@ScrubDetector if we get a new Minecraft world can it be bedrock ü•∫üëâüèΩüëàüèΩ

[08-Aug-20 11:37 AM] lenoxtOwOst#0909
Wtf


[08-Aug-20 11:38 AM] Ovey#0001
The problem with bedrock is that java is usually more up-to-date and is better for most things (Other than crossplay). So Java is usually the way to go for community servers etc. 

To have a bedrock server would mean getting even more staff to manage and maintain server that only a few people would play on.

TBH, if you can just get java and come join the rest of us play üôÇ

yet you dont second guess it when you sign up to a website


[14-Aug-20 04:49 PM] James#0007
even tho there are thousands of database breaches each day, and millions of emails leaked


[14-Aug-20 04:49 PM] Poinda#0220
Well ya know


[14-Aug-20 04:49 PM] James#0007
the odds of you email being leaked is at once a week


[14-Aug-20 04:49 PM] Poinda#0220
Ur email is all over the internet the moment u use it on a site

[14-Aug-20 04:51 PM] James#0007
if you use windows, your info is public to alot of large companies

[14-Aug-20 04:54 PM] AndrewBeats#0985
> yet you dont second guess it when you sign up to a website
@James i use my fake email for that


[14-Aug-20 04:55 PM] James#0007
just a straight lie. 90% of websites ask for confirmation. And its anything but dumb to use fake emails, as its against TOS of every website in the world to use fake information


[14-Aug-20 04:56 PM] James#0007
plus if you lose access to your account, enjoy getting it back

@Mortexüá¨üáß beach (used to be mod but now he‚Äôs admin) helped me figure out that she stole it, but he hasn‚Äôt had his admin training yet so he wasn‚Äôt sure how to actually help get my stuff back.


[17-Aug-20 02:18 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I definitely feel like there should be some sort of 3 strikes and you‚Äôre out system. Lik would have been gone a long time ago if there was, because they steal all the time.

@Mortexüá¨üáß Actually the problem isnt no on was on, but that no higher staff member was on. our new staff members are mods and do not have the ability to rollback.


[17-Aug-20 02:20 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@ArunkaLooks Also the issue with lik has always been petty. From what I understand at least. We do have a strike system, but typically just for stealing, griefing, racism. Which lik has only been caught 1 time from as far as i know.


[17-Aug-20 02:21 PM] CommunistBean#8354
and i think if we did get the ability to rollback it would make it really complicated towards new mods like me.


[17-Aug-20 02:21 PM] Poinda#0220
it would also make abuse easier


[17-Aug-20 02:21 PM] CommunistBean#8354
true


[17-Aug-20 02:21 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
yes of course, its easy to make mistakes with that


[17-Aug-20 02:22 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
@ScrubDetector see from what I‚Äôve been hearing from people, lik has stolen and griefed far more. But like I said that‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve heard.


[17-Aug-20 02:22 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yea, again. people dont know all of the truth


[17-Aug-20 02:23 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I‚Äôve heard it from mods too though. But who knows


[17-Aug-20 02:23 PM] CommunistBean#8354
yeah, she has way too clean of a record on /history compared to what shes done imo


[17-Aug-20 02:24 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
Bean I was warned by beach so plz Unban me bro he also taken th stuff I stolen


[17-Aug-20 02:24 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
So stay out of it


[17-Aug-20 02:25 PM] CommunistBean#8354
but again, im not the one to judge since i just become a mod


[17-Aug-20 02:25 PM] CommunistBean#8354
@LIKLIKLIK15 bruh i just changed to 1.8.9


[17-Aug-20 02:25 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Bro why so far backüò≠


[17-Aug-20 02:25 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
U flipping reported scrub because u want revenge for me killing your dog


[17-Aug-20 02:26 PM] CommunistBean#8354
im playing hypixel and im using lunar ich is either 1.7. something or 1.8.9


[17-Aug-20 02:26 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Ahhh makes sense


[17-Aug-20 02:26 PM] CommunistBean#8354
@LIKLIKLIK15 bruh


[17-Aug-20 02:26 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
Don't matter you banned me for no reason


[17-Aug-20 02:27 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
It was taken care of


[17-Aug-20 02:27 PM] CommunistBean#8354
dude, i literally asked scrub how long i should ban a xray hacker for and he asked me if i knew how long ur ban was lmao


[17-Aug-20 02:28 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@LIKLIKLIK15 You werent banned for no reason


[17-Aug-20 02:28 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
I see.


[17-Aug-20 02:29 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Take it to tickets man.


[17-Aug-20 02:29 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
@ScrubDetector  I was warned for stealing by beachpartysteave and I promise not to steal and to this day I havent


[17-Aug-20 02:29 PM] CommunistBean#8354
she opened a ticket but is impatient


[17-Aug-20 02:29 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Smh.


[17-Aug-20 02:29 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
@Mortexüá¨üáß  no obe answers me


[17-Aug-20 02:30 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
You have to wait till a staff is online.


[17-Aug-20 02:30 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
They r online


[17-Aug-20 02:30 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@LIKLIKLIK15 If it was up to me you would be banned for 10 more hours


[17-Aug-20 02:30 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Cause they online doesn't mean that they actually at there computers


[17-Aug-20 02:31 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
@ScrubDetector  now that's uncalled for bro at least be kind for once :(


[17-Aug-20 02:32 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
That is not uncalled for. Stealing in real life puts you in jail.


[17-Aug-20 02:33 PM] CommunistBean#8354
scrub spittin straight facts bro


[17-Aug-20 02:33 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Amen


[17-Aug-20 02:33 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
@ScrubDetector bro look i was warned thats it you dont need to go further but bean is just a bad mod and did not like the outcome


[17-Aug-20 02:33 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Let's be real here. You broke the server rules. You are temp banned now I presume just wait it out and don't do the same thing you did when you got your self banned.


[17-Aug-20 02:34 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Simple as that.


[17-Aug-20 02:34 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
it was fine with a warning plus the stuff got taken off me


[17-Aug-20 02:34 PM] CommunistBean#8354
on top of that, complaining wont help and may even get the ban extended by some time

I thought people couldn't steal anyways cause of grief prevention plug?


[17-Aug-20 02:39 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411

@ArunkaLooks huge favor, make a ticket about this. 

And say that you need more and scrub said so. Lmao..

Also claiming a shop is pretty pointless because then you can‚Äôt get any sales. We are getting our shop keepers plugin back though!

Stretching is important. Sitting at a desk for a long time can hurt your back and neck. Be sure to take care of yourself @ScrubDetector


[18-Aug-20 10:47 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@That1Hufflepuff yea, I think imma make some channel points where we do excersises and stretches

That's a good idea.


[18-Aug-20 10:48 AM] Avoided#6038
and he had another one for pushups


[18-Aug-20 10:53 AM] That1Hufflepuff#1776
I'm fond of yoga myself. It's a wonderful full body workout and the stretches keep you flexible and can relieve muscle tension. It's also very relaxing to me.

Still don't have my PC hooked up to WiFi, so I can only play offline solo Minecraft. And although it's fun, its kind of disappointing. Because I make these detailed builds, but no one else is able to join the world and see them. üòÖ

Because I have a puppy with the bladder of a squirrel @ScrubDetector


[22-Aug-20 08:58 AM] That1Hufflepuff#1776
I have to wake up early every day to take him for a morning walk. He is usually pretty chill and not a super hyper dog, but he's apparently a morning person and likes to get the zoomies as soon as he's let out of his crate of the morning.


[22-Aug-20 08:59 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Omg @That1Hufflepuff my dogs are the same way it‚Äôs awful


[22-Aug-20 09:00 AM] That1Hufflepuff#1776
Like come late evening/night time when I have energy, he's dead to the world, wanting to nap and if you wake him up for walks, he pouts. But if its morning, we have to go and it has to be right then. üòÖ üòÇ


[22-Aug-20 09:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
xD


[22-Aug-20 09:02 AM] That1Hufflepuff#1776
He can also apparently twist his head just right to reach his name tag and likes to chew on it. So it appears I'll be buying him one of the collars with the name plate on it instead of a dangling tag.

So my puppy Diesel found a dog treat under the edge of the fridge, so he was trying to paw it out from under there and eat it. And my boyfriend thought he was trying to eat a magnet, so he reached into his mouth and took it. After realizing it was a treat, he gave it back to him. Meanwhile, I'm dying with laughter like "You just took a treat from the puppy. That's like stealing candy from a baby. You monster!" üòÇ üòÇ

I only remember the basics of German, but I can sometimes figure out what someone is saying (if its typed) based on sentence structure and words I recognise. But in person, i'm pretty usless these days :fifiDerp:  so out of practice

what does it mean


[14-Sep-20 09:17 AM] Toka_xo#3664
It means no, but there are other alternatives depending on the sentence

Buddha Chair
Buddha means "enlightened" and our hand-carved teak chair embodies this goal.  A literal representation of the protection asana (pose), the raised, open hand symbolizes a shield, signifying courage and offering protection from fear, delusion and anger.

@ùïãùï†ùïíùï§ùï•‚êà - I shouldn't have joined it.

I run a company I was expecting someone to reach out to me, didn't remember Odog until I joined.
that Discord does not stand with my values, I spoke up and said what I had to say.

You all should know you are on the PUBLIC internet. Anything you say will always be on the internet. We are in a new age with the world. Society is changing; there is no room for hate. There is no room to discriminate against any one no matter their beliefs or color.

Thats all im going to say and i'm not going to talk about this again.

If you need any server help make a Ticket, do not reach out to me.


[19-Sep-20 04:05 PM] ùïãùï†ùïíùï§ùï•‚êà#5485

Cmon man, dont be like this. Why cant people like you accept things like these, i really just want people to smile, i know that its not funny watching somebody cough, but he lives just fine.


[23-Sep-20 10:10 PM] nuggie#7574
but you dont need to post it in multiple channels


[23-Sep-20 10:12 PM] Mrunusualpeytonreal#2549
Well you dont NEED to have discord. you dont NEED to be in this discord group. What you really need, is to enlighten up a little bit. I dont know if times are hard for you right now, but they sure as hell are for me.


[23-Sep-20 10:13 PM] nuggie#7574

How does it affect or effect, whichever it is. How does it cause you to feel any kind of emotional or physical pain? Whats bad about me breaking the order of a discord group?


[23-Sep-20 10:16 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
You only need to post it in one channel of the discord.

[24-Sep-20 08:48 PM] ragingrex101#7847
ok thats ok i guess


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a specific time if I remember correctly from my old server. I think it‚Äôs just you put in the amount of time you want


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] ragingrex101#7847
I just finished revamping my house but I would still have the stuff


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] nuggie#7574
aight


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
And currently you‚Äôd need 30mins maybe an hour


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] poof#0503
Dont worry, even if the rollback goes back really far, we can just postpone the build comp


[24-Sep-20 08:49 PM] ragingrex101#7847

> "owners of servers to install the jar file you receive as it is a plugin. They install it on their minecraft server and you can start taking over!"
@Mortexüá¨üáß I dont think the managers would install a hacked plugin now would they?


[25-Sep-20 09:43 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I‚Äôd hope not


[25-Sep-20 09:44 AM] Ovey#0001
Do you not have the server files backed up at a separate location?


[25-Sep-20 09:48 AM] AsianSensation227#0671
Oh my god, I just joined yesterday

[25-Sep-20 09:48 AM] AsianSensation227#0671
I hate it when a server gets griefed

[25-Sep-20 10:08 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
@Ovey someone said the server gets saved weekly for some reason


[25-Sep-20 10:08 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
and the other issue is that the hacker forced saved the server


[25-Sep-20 10:08 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
after griefing


[25-Sep-20 10:13 AM] Dirty Dan#9475
Do we know the player names that griefed?


[25-Sep-20 10:15 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Yes, it should be taken care of for the most part now.


[25-Sep-20 10:17 AM] daytonagk#0166

And I‚Äôm gonna be IV sedated so imma be chillingüòé


[25-Sep-20 10:21 AM] daytonagk#0166
From what I remember is they put a needle in you and then you like go out in like 10 seconds


[25-Sep-20 10:21 AM] daytonagk#0166
But after that I don‚Äôt know


[25-Sep-20 10:21 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265

[25-Sep-20 10:22 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Did you get laughing gas too


[25-Sep-20 10:22 AM] daytonagk#0166
The funny thing is is that I told them the time when I had to have 2 doctors hold me down to put 2 shots in my butt


[25-Sep-20 10:23 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I‚Äôve been thereüòÇ


[25-Sep-20 10:23 AM] daytonagk#0166
Yes I did get the gas but the needle was the thing that freaked me out


[25-Sep-20 10:23 AM] ArunkaLooks#5265
I think I‚Äôll be good with the needle part tbh. As long as I don‚Äôt look I‚Äôm usually fine


[25-Sep-20 10:24 AM] daytonagk#0166
Ya that‚Äôs what really happens they said hey you can let go of your fist and I said I fewl@better if I dont

you really arent supposed to put your base near spawn


[27-Sep-20 11:50 AM] nuggie#7574

[27-Sep-20 12:25 PM] screendawg#1342

First of all, I didn't "Destroy your home"  I told you not to build next to spawn because that's the basic rule of literally any server and you placed a sign that said "I moved" so I destroyed the base you started. You dying has nothing at all to do with me. Second, make a ticket next time instead of bad mouthing senior staff in general chat. Thanks, - MGMT @screendawg

[04-Oct-20 10:12 AM] The Major#1663
Hades is a panel that's connected to an API, it's not meant for ddosing, it's used as a c2 (control panel) like a cpanel

kekw 

[04-Oct-20 10:12 AM] The Major#1663
but a little different


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] NerdoftheYear531#0206
It's literally a ddos program that many hackers use, I found this out with a simple google search-


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] OANE#1489
well look asian


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] The Major#1663
"ddos program"?


[04-Oct-20 10:14 AM] The Major#1663
those don't exist, at least, not any working ones, and if they do (things like LOIC and HOIC) are DOS tools, not ddos


[04-Oct-20 10:14 AM] NerdoftheYear531#0206
well, how would you know?


[04-Oct-20 10:14 AM] OANE#1489
because he ddosed the server


[04-Oct-20 10:15 AM] The Major#1663
because i know?


[04-Oct-20 10:16 AM] The Major#1663
it's simple information, we live in the age of technology you should do some research about it, they're always an interesting thing to learn about modern technology

[04-Oct-20 10:22 AM] Litt#9053
Lets just refrain from putting any sort of IPs in the discord besides play.scrub.network! üòÑ

also, tell MrScrub he needs to close all of these ports, except for 22, but he still needs to filter that one, infact, if he's the only one that does any changes on the server side, he needs to whitelist his ip, and black list all other ips, so that they can't ddos port 22. Here's what i suggest, whitelist his ip on the server for SSH so he can connect to it, but no one else can (can prevent hacking, scanning, and payload infections) and set up the iptables to drop any blacklisted ips going to port 22, this will stop any ddoses on port 22. Close all the other ports, open port 25588, start hosting minecraft, and listening on that port. and set up your iptables to protect that port. Boom, 99.9998% of people wouldn't be able to ddos his minecraft server

@The Major His Servers has over 480gbps ddos protection.

His ports means f all


[04-Oct-20 11:22 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
You want to block ports so they don't get exploited


[04-Oct-20 11:22 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
or shelled


[04-Oct-20 11:22 AM] The Major#1663
His server does not have 480gig of ddos protection i promist


[04-Oct-20 11:22 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Also why Port 22 ?


[04-Oct-20 11:22 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
I would change that


[04-Oct-20 11:23 AM] The Major#1663
Why what port 22?


[04-Oct-20 11:23 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Skids aka White Hackers uses there scripts to attack common ports


[04-Oct-20 11:23 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Also Knowing OpenSSH is exploitable too xD


[04-Oct-20 11:25 AM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Also Blocking ports still won't matter as if they did a local file attack on any of the site they can just open a reversed shell port


[04-Oct-20 11:25 AM] The Major#1663
"Skids aka White Hackers" a White hat hacker is someone who uses hacking in a legal way, a "skid" is a less cultured deduct from script kitty, which refers to someone who uses someone else's code and calls it their own (basically the copy writers of the internet)

I mean, you don't have to believe me, but the if you're saying closing a port doesn't change the outcome of a ddos attack is false

Is a DDoS possible if the port being attacked is closed?
Let's assume a hypothetical situation in which port 50000 of a machine was being bombarded with UDP packets. However, port 50000 on said machine isn't actually open (i.e. the machine is not listeni...

Hm, anyways, i feel like those suggestions should prevent a vast majority of ddos attacks, but if i heard correctly, i think he bought a new server while on stream, so ig it doesn't matter now, but if he's gonna set up a new server, i suggest implementing my suggestions on the new server

@MassDistrukt Next time you feel like someone is bothering you let staff know


[07-Oct-20 07:50 PM] Devi.#0116
Sending a message isn't being silent


[07-Oct-20 07:50 PM] RealityGamer04#3868

yeah


[07-Oct-20 07:54 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188
cuz that in itself can give anxiety.


[07-Oct-20 07:54 PM] BrittyBird#5621
@MassDistrukt yeah I can't believe that happened to you I'm so sorry about that. I'm the same way but people like that are why I never talk about it

[07-Oct-20 07:59 PM] BrittyBird#5621
I've never been bullied myself, but I've gotten plenty of verbal abuse which sometimes is a lot worse


[07-Oct-20 07:59 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188

I'm basically 17 and I have a hard time irl, which is why I keep with my online friends cuz the people I have met are more understanding and mature than the people I go to school with


[07-Oct-20 08:05 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188
my best friend irl im not as close to her as my online best friend*


[07-Oct-20 08:06 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188

[07-Oct-20 08:07 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188
im also one of those poeple that will be in a group and start talking, then people usually ignore or talk over me xD i gave up at this point in life, i just gotta tell myself idgaf


[07-Oct-20 08:08 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188
i dont relate to "average people" just gamers and people with health problems


[07-Oct-20 08:09 PM] MassDistrukt#2619
yeah


[07-Oct-20 08:09 PM] .TŒπnk—îrb—îll`#3188
but real talk, once u get out of school and move on , ull find people are "better" in the real world...cant say for all but there are more than in school


[07-Oct-20 08:10 PM] MassDistrukt#2619

[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
I don‚Äôt think they float...


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Cactus#5145
üòÇ


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Cactus#5145
Depends on the wood type


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
Um


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
No?


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
A piece of cedar, which is rather light, will easily float on top of water.


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Mortexüá¨üáß#8361
Um Yes


[11-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Cactus#5145
Balsa wood floats


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
It‚Äôs floating on water...


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] beardogcat#9474
In the US we measure with literal feet


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
Not away


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] beardogcat#9474
So feet are different sizes


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] beardogcat#9474
so someone could be 10 feet tall


[11-Oct-20 01:16 PM] beardogcat#9474
But with small feet

> What does senpai mean
@GalaxyGurl13 senpai is an upperclassman who mentors an underclassman, or kohai. This term is used most often in English in reference to anime and manga and originates from Japanese ÂÖàËº©, "earlier colleague". Used more broadly to mean "teacher" or "master."

[25-Oct-20 12:56 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265

[25-Oct-20 12:56 PM] Alana Walker#1221

[25-Oct-20 12:58 PM] Annie#5958
i agree with arunka, but lets really vote and see what everyone thinks... so far i've heard at least 6 people want a restart :P

> no trestart boi
@Dirty Dan FINALLY SOMEONEW AGREES


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
Tbh tho I think a restart during charity stream could bring a lot of new people inüíÄ


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] OANE#1489
well scrub has a poll


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
boi if you keep restarting it month after month no big bases will get build


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] nuggie#7574
we have to restart every few months or it will get boring


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] Annie#5958
alana calm down please and yes it will, it would be a full server restart, no items, no base


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
since it isnt worth it to build for a month and then seing it all gone


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@ArunkaLooks true but imma be so busy, and I want to use some of the things we have built


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] ArunkaLooks#5265
@Dirty Dan this server has been up for a while. I know of a lot of big bases


[25-Oct-20 01:01 PM] Annie#5958
the server has been up for a few months already tho


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
i would say do a restart when 1.17 comes out


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] nuggie#7574
im sorry if you are upset with the decision that he has made to restart the server soon


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] Alana Walker#1221
if i have a ender chgest, will it save there?!?!


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
We restart 2-3 months


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] nuggie#7574
but the server has been up for a while now


[25-Oct-20 01:02 PM] ScrubDetector#7361

[25-Oct-20 01:04 PM] Photoshopfreak#3157
My thing is. People will probably be getting busy around Thanksgiving. Then you've got Christmas and all of that holiday time.


[25-Oct-20 01:04 PM] nuggie#7574

[25-Oct-20 01:05 PM] Annie#5958
some people are already bored because they have nothing to do, and a lot of people are already planning what they will do on the restarted server


[25-Oct-20 01:05 PM] OANE#1489

what is a stream restart


[25-Oct-20 01:07 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
but if we restart can the terrain atleast get fixed because its just glitchy at somepoints like full lines 10 blocks above ground and stuff which doesnt look natural and at coastal regions its just a pain to see


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] OANE#1489
i like the terain


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
oh and add mountain biome


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] nuggie#7574
that would be up to the devs and scrub


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] Alana Walker#1221
@ScrubDetector if new resart, can i have my bas under again??


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
because its no fun to trade for emeralds since i like the mining aspect


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] nuggie#7574
well boohoo cracker


[25-Oct-20 01:08 PM] nuggie#7574
thats probably a you thing


[25-Oct-20 01:09 PM] Dirty Dan#9475
and the terrain is nice but its just i dont want to mine those lines all day to let my builds look nice


[25-Oct-20 01:11 PM] Alana Walker#1221

[27-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Sipity Sip#7424
as of now yes, they stated they won't reactivate their account, they didn't go over the reasoning all they said is that since he broke the terms and service it's deactivated and they wont unbann/reactivate


[27-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Wiwwyo#1097
so what now is it a perma ban or temporary ban?
