Alright, this is obviously unacceptable. The server is officially going to undergo maintenance. I will not be able to fix anything or make changes until 2 pm. The server is offline at the moment though. Please forgive me for not seeing this until now. I will be looking into different ways to protect your builds and stop hackers from breaching into the server. My deepest apologies everyone who has spent hours already into the server. Please give me ideas and a list of plugins to help with these issues; all of your suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Please be patient during this maintenance period.


[16-Oct-19 12:37 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I've pinned the Plugins list


[16-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
It's my fault


[16-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I asked him if he followed the stream as i didn't recognise his name on mc and he told me he did follow the stream


[16-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[16-Oct-19 12:42 PM] ScrubDetector#7361

❤❤❤


[17-Oct-19 07:54 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Just a few new updates on the server.
-permissions granted per rank.
-5 total ranks
-the world will now auto save every 3 hours
-fire spread is turned off
-you will not be able to place lava or tnt (temp)
-new anti cheat plugins
-vpn protection
And many many more. I will give a list of all plugins in the future. Please note that all is subject to change.

The goal is to keep the server as grief proof as possible without losing the core survival feel. I hope you all enjoy and your feedback is greatly appreciated! @everyone

@ScrubSupport Someone raided my house and stole literally everything. They also broke into my neighbor (Poof, I think?) and cleaned him out. This server thing ain't working.


[18-Oct-19 02:39 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
Cleaned out Watermelon's place as well. I'm going around to everyone's home, but it looks like he got pretty much everyone.


[18-Oct-19 02:42 PM] courtdadork#3563
Yea we know, we banned him this morning. Unfortunately he did all that stuff though :/ they’re gonna work on some more server stuff later today


[18-Oct-19 02:42 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
@Nia your house is clean too


[18-Oct-19 02:42 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
So you know who did it?


[18-Oct-19 02:42 PM] courtdadork#3563
He started everything on fire as well so thankfully fire spread was off and yea


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] courtdadork#3563
His name was TheDarthToast which is just this guy named Toast who keeps making accounts and fucking everything up


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] courtdadork#3563
But hopefully we got him for good this time!


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
What a fucking cuck


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] courtdadork#3563
I know right


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
I hope so, I had like 40 diamonds, 60 gold, and a bunch of diamond and gold swords, he got everything.


[18-Oct-19 02:43 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
He must have hid it somewhere though, right?


[18-Oct-19 02:44 PM] courtdadork#3563
I know, he took literally everyone’s stuff, I have no idea where it would be though. Nia also has a house full of dogs and I only saw one this morning so that bastard did the unthinkable I think!


[18-Oct-19 02:44 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
He took the door off of Nia's hinges, wtf. This man is a savage


[18-Oct-19 02:45 PM] courtdadork#3563
I know, like mega cunt


[18-Oct-19 02:46 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Don't worry server going to be on maintenance for a while till 4pm central time


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I love cunt 😋


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
He even cleaned Nate out. What a dick


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
We know :p


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
But he doesn't know what tho


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
I did some security late last night, he must have been playing really early this morning


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Has been touched


[18-Oct-19 02:47 PM] courtdadork#3563
Yea I got on at 8:40ish this morning and he was on


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] courtdadork#3563
Flying around in creative and killing me!


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
he dont have creative


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
It just looks like everything is empty in this cave he was in. The zombie spawn thing is fucked too


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] courtdadork#3563
I don’t know how he was flying then but it was weird


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Yeah he was modding


[18-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
so i was supposed to be going to sleep for 2 hours


[18-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
but.. my mum decided to call me and was on phone for 30 mins


[18-Oct-19 02:49 PM] courtdadork#3563
Mortex get sleep!


[18-Oct-19 02:49 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[18-Oct-19 02:49 PM] courtdadork#3563
Yea you definitely need sleep


[18-Oct-19 02:50 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[18-Oct-19 02:52 PM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749

[18-Oct-19 02:54 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

Drop a follow on the stream and join the ScrubNation MC Server: Scrubnation.wither.co


[20-Oct-19 10:03 AM] sofortgold#6360

[20-Oct-19 10:32 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Let me look into it


[20-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
@ScrubDetector I'm gonna take a couple of days off


[20-Oct-19 10:35 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yes Mortex you do that! I appreciate all the help, make sure you focus on you before anything!


[20-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Okay thanks, i will do


[20-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
if you need help with plugins or what not ill still be around


[20-Oct-19 10:36 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I appreciate it, I think I might add some more people to “admin” and what not. Think I know some people we can trust.


[20-Oct-19 10:36 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Gotta re look at all the perms because nia had no power at admin


[20-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I'm gonna mess around with some fireworks


[20-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Cartplayz#0138

[20-Oct-19 10:40 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
@Nia tell @ScrubDetector what perms where missing for you


[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Sweet! Go have fun!


[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] Nia#6083
Ok, wel


[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] Nia#6083
i think i have everything right now 🙂


[20-Oct-19 10:41 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Cartplayz yo what’s your Mc name


[20-Oct-19 10:43 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Nia as operator you should have about everything. But imma need to add perms for admin to let them have more power. Like the ability to kick, timeout, ect.


[20-Oct-19 10:43 AM] Nia#6083
Yea, that sounds good


[20-Oct-19 10:44 AM] Nia#6083
thats about all you need as admin. Kick, timeout,and the coreprotect comands. this way instead of giving gamemode access, you can use coreprotect to give players there things back if there killed by others


[20-Oct-19 10:47 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Ooh.. I think imma need to get core protect again. I believe we uninstalled! But that seems like a great command.


[20-Oct-19 10:47 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Its still on.


[20-Oct-19 10:47 AM] Nia#6083
yea theres a lot of good core protect comands


[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Nia#6083
like /co roll back


[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Nia#6083
so if something is destroyed you can roll back an location


[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Nia#6083
same with chests


[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Nia#6083
but i guess we already


[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Nia#6083

[20-Oct-19 10:48 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[20-Oct-19 10:51 AM] Nia#6083
well yea illl make a list of coreprotect for you


[20-Oct-19 10:51 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Mortex🇬🇧 just heads up I don’t know if you sent that config file or if you didn’t have time


[20-Oct-19 10:52 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I was doing it last night but i hoped off as i went awful

[20-Oct-19 10:52 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Sorry


[20-Oct-19 10:53 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Just making sure because last night people said they messaged me on discord but I got nothing


[20-Oct-19 10:53 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Yeah when you stream, discord auto turns on streamer mode so it blocks all notifications


[20-Oct-19 10:53 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
While streaming


[20-Oct-19 10:54 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Cartplayz good to go!


[20-Oct-19 10:55 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Its a fresh server people gonna expect stuff to be done over time and especially when im ill


[20-Oct-19 11:01 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

[20-Oct-19 11:17 AM] ScrubDetector#7361

[20-Oct-19 03:09 PM] ScrubDetector#7361

@ScrubDetector can you crack the server when you gonna stream and play in it???


[20-Oct-19 10:25 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
No. I apologize cryptoz but I have a set of rules and cannot let you slide in without letting everyone slide in.

[20-Oct-19 10:39 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I recommend just spending the money to buy the game. You will sink a ton of time into it, on the server we have a good time and I would like to have you on.

How am I going to get ready...


[22-Oct-19 09:53 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
We will do some mining together. Also mad enchanting.


[22-Oct-19 10:33 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@everyone Also tomorrow we will be doing a special “subscriber” only event at 5 PM central standard time. You have to be a subscriber to participate, I will give more details on the event before the stream. They’re will be a winner in this event and a prize for winning!


[22-Oct-19 10:33 PM] Clean#8406

hey im subbed but i dont have the role


[22-Oct-19 11:50 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Make sure you come to the stream before the competition and I will give you your correct role. What is your IGN? Also make sure you go to the setting in discord to link your twitch to your discord account and then your sub role will show in here.


[22-Oct-19 11:52 PM] ObedientCorgi18#4189
what's IGN?


[22-Oct-19 11:53 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
In game name, your Minecraft name


[22-Oct-19 11:54 PM] ObedientCorgi18#4189
oh right i dont have java yet 😂


[22-Oct-19 11:55 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
😂  well either way if you want it to show in discord just link your twitch account!


[22-Oct-19 11:56 PM] ObedientCorgi18#4189
just did


[22-Oct-19 11:56 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Sweet so if you are subbed it should show now. (:


[22-Oct-19 11:58 PM] ObedientCorgi18#4189
its still not


[23-Oct-19 12:02 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
What is your twitch name??


[23-Oct-19 12:05 AM] ObedientCorgi18#4189
obedientcorgi13


[23-Oct-19 12:21 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Their it’s working! That goes for everyone though! If you are subbed make sure you link that twitch account to your discord, so you get the cool purple name and can use emotes in discord!


[23-Oct-19 12:30 AM] ObedientCorgi18#4189

I’ll look into it but I know beach is pretty new at Minecraft, he was mining at level 30 for diamonds a couple of times. I’ve known him for a while, I think he’s just got an unusual way. I will hop on and look into it though.

Okay Guys, If you die in the end.. Fall to your death, killed by a mob, mine a block out from under yourself, dont type /home quick enough then you will NOT be getting your things back. End Farming comes with series risk! Buy what you need from someone if your not willing to risk it! Thanks @everyone

a food event first one to make a cake wins but you can’t use anything you already own gotta have empty inventory and make a cake with the stuff you can find in the wild like a egg , wheat, sugar and 3 milk bags

[30-Oct-19 04:59 PM] JonathanAFK#6389
Or a fish event who can fish up the best stuff in 10 minutes cause you can get fish or books or other good stuff and you count those as point


[30-Oct-19 04:59 PM] JonathanAFK#6389
You should have a boat event where you make a course for boats and 4 people get to race in 2 laps

[04-Nov-19 03:27 AM] CyanideCyclops#2295
Bois. I know its early. But, I have an idea for xmas. In/near spawn we build a massive xmas tree out of spruce and decorate it with lanterns, end rods mob heads ect. Hell even player heads would be cool, adds some personal touch. Plus if we have heads we can add an armor stand at the top, give it scrubs head, so he can be the angel on the tree lol. Maybe even have a server secret santa. Just a thought.

[04-Nov-19 06:17 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Basically someone greifed the cave when i logged on yesterday morning (everyone was offline) i decided to rollback but i did not know at the time you could set a radius. So kinda rollbacked the whole server. I thinking only where you stand would get rolledback...


[04-Nov-19 06:17 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
So everyone base got basically rolledback to a griefed state.

[04-Nov-19 06:18 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Set for some, also after i restored my mistake, scrub did rollback again because he wanted to restore a old jser build but went to far back so idk


[04-Nov-19 06:19 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
Not being an ass, just genuinely curious, why did beach and poof still lose their things?

Everything I touched got restored, yesterday. Beaches base isn’t restored properly, also poof has all of her stuff to my knowledge.


[04-Nov-19 08:33 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Yeah poof didn't, i gave her creative to restore her stuff what she lost and you (if i recall) changed her back to survival after she was done.

From what I understand restoring should restore items in the chests


[04-Nov-19 08:55 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
But beach saying his base looks like it has been griefed gives me the impression the restoration radius wasn’t perfect


[04-Nov-19 09:02 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I'll check in a bit to see if theres a restore command for chests x

Hmmm. So the only blocks it cant break are bedrock and command blocks?


[04-Nov-19 01:10 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yes sir


[04-Nov-19 01:53 PM] CyanideCyclops#2295
I have one other idea which may be kinda cool. Regular mob/xp farms are kinda boring right? You just sit there and click. Well, What if we had an arena like a colluseum. have some spawners with the different mobs in them. And let people grind xp there lol adds some danger and fun into the mix. Even have a roman throne area/vip spectator area where people can watch the fights from. Perhaps charging em to watch. (You could become rich scrub lol). Just a thought.


[04-Nov-19 03:18 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Haha I like it, we do kinda already have a way to fight mobs in an arena scenario. Not necessarily for xp though

So. The suggestion for demise: Basically its a last man standing thing. We have the living and the dead. The living have to survive till the last person and the dead have to lay traps to kill the living. (When you die you become a dead). Maybe have it so you put in a diamond block or something to play. And the last man standing gets ALL the diamond blocks (or whatever it is you decided to use to play) we use player heads to show whos dead and alive. (Diamond armor and totems of undying are NOT allowed)

True tho


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] SharpZ#1498
had the most redstone


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] SharpZ#1498
honorable mention


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
That’s true. I was more worried about fixing the Redstone after I broke it lol


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Haha


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
You gotta teach me the stairs


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Is that a timing thing?


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
The stairs were just built again this morning.


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh yeah. Lots of repeaters


[06-Nov-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Think like 17


[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Damn. I heard honey blocks are gunna change redstone forever.


[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
And about 20 pistons


[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
It’s gunna be so easy to do stairs and huge redstone doors I guess


[06-Nov-19 09:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Was a big ass hole when I started lol

My damn 0 tick farm didn’t work, that was a day wasted.


[06-Nov-19 09:57 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Do they?? I’m so behind on Minecraft updates it’s so not cool


[06-Nov-19 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Has to be something server side


[06-Nov-19 09:57 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I wonder if we have a plugin that blocks 0 tick farms


[06-Nov-19 09:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
I woulda had the best xp farm if it worked lol


[06-Nov-19 09:58 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
We have world guard that doesn’t allow you on the top of the nether


[06-Nov-19 09:58 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I’m not even sure how they work to be honest


[06-Nov-19 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basically, pistons move a block back and forth non stop and bamboo grows quick.


[06-Nov-19 10:00 PM] SharpZ#1498
no Pigmen farm then :c


[06-Nov-19 10:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I’m asking the dev team. I’ll make a server tomorrow and see as well


[06-Nov-19 10:02 PM] SharpZ#1498
But that would increase lag by a lot


[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Probably


[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] SharpZ#1498
Had to use multiple designs for my piston door cause all the others jammed due to lag


[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Might be a lag prevention setting then?


[06-Nov-19 10:03 PM] SharpZ#1498
I dont know honestly


[06-Nov-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
WG does not prevent 0 tick farms


[06-Nov-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
Per dev


[06-Nov-19 10:04 PM] Akah#4444
Lag prevention? that probably sounds closer to what it'd be then. Zero ticks are quite intensive on servers, with the amount of updates per tick


[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I just want my do bank to work


[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Xp


[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] SharpZ#1498
Just do a slower one


[06-Nov-19 10:05 PM] SharpZ#1498
May not be as effective


[06-Nov-19 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I already have a slower one. But it’s way too slow lol


[06-Nov-19 10:06 PM] SharpZ#1498
But it will help the server alot


[06-Nov-19 10:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have about 4 stacks of cacti and 0 fuel


[06-Nov-19 10:06 PM] SharpZ#1498
Lava buckers


[06-Nov-19 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Oh to fuel the furnace?


[06-Nov-19 10:07 PM] SharpZ#1498
Yea


[06-Nov-19 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm.... might try that then.


[06-Nov-19 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Have a ton of lava already


[06-Nov-19 10:08 PM] SharpZ#1498
They burn a long time


[06-Nov-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Good. I’ll try that in the morning then


[06-Nov-19 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe I will end up with 2 slime farms lol


[06-Nov-19 10:09 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Make a kelp farm instead


[06-Nov-19 10:09 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Or bamboo with a flying machine


[06-Nov-19 10:10 PM] SharpZ#1498
Yeah Lava fuels for 1000 seconds


[06-Nov-19 10:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Bamboo is too slow growing for me. That’s what is killing my bank. Run out of fuel too quick


[06-Nov-19 10:10 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
You can burn kelp blocks


[06-Nov-19 10:10 PM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
That’s all i use for my furnaces, all my coal goes into torches lol


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
So it’s not WG even with lag


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Something else is making them stop


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Ohh I know


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I think you need to claim pistons


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Did you do that


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Why?


[06-Nov-19 10:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
They were on my land.


[06-Nov-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
But only one piston activated


[06-Nov-19 10:12 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Idk uraka told me because my surgar cane farm wouldn’t work


[06-Nov-19 10:12 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Try to claim just to be sure


[06-Nov-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm. Ok. Will try in the morning.


[06-Nov-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
What plugin is that? WG as well?


[06-Nov-19 10:13 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yes I believe


[06-Nov-19 10:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Regions?


[06-Nov-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Gah almost wish I could just get a copy of your server so I could fix it lol


[06-Nov-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
You could always pop into the WG discord and ask them 🙂


[06-Nov-19 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
But, WG does nothing unless you enable it. So if it is WG then someone turned it on. But they say it shouldn’t touch farms


[06-Nov-19 10:18 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Hmm 🤔 I am learning as I go


[06-Nov-19 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
The devs said it will be easier for you to ask them lol since you know how it’s all set up


[06-Nov-19 10:22 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I would need to be sitting at my computer.


[06-Nov-19 10:23 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I definitely know way less than you give me credit, and that’s not much.


[06-Nov-19 10:27 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Deleted User could it be grief prevention?


[06-Nov-19 10:28 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
We use grief prevention for claiming

@ScrubDetector what you think about getting a Wacky Wheel? what it is, is you spin it and something either good or bad happens it's a pandora's box of sorts


[20-Nov-19 09:19 AM] ScrubDetector#7361

I will look at it. As it happens I do not want our minecraft server to lose its base vanilla feeling. As it already has in some regards.

[22-Nov-19 09:44 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Oh


[22-Nov-19 09:45 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
well, he’s definetly lagging the server


[22-Nov-19 09:47 AM] amber#2184
you think so? i can’t get on rn cause i’m not home :tristao: but it’s weird cause he was on when everyone was on and it was fine until a certain time then it went all booboo


[22-Nov-19 09:53 AM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
I was on death screen for past 6 hrs or so


[22-Nov-19 09:53 AM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
And no i am not lagging the server, I'm afk on my iron farm


[22-Nov-19 09:55 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Huh


[22-Nov-19 09:56 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Well, still extremely strange that the server is on like 6 tps


[22-Nov-19 09:57 AM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
I spend around 90% of my time here, so if it was me it would've lag the server every time im am on it


[22-Nov-19 09:58 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
? That’s shitty logic


[22-Nov-19 09:58 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
i’m saying you’re using a lag machine


[22-Nov-19 09:58 AM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578

Chill, we having to edit a few things in a bit that will possibly sort the lag out


[22-Nov-19 10:49 AM] Deleted User#0000

Looks like they need a server reload or reboot. That’s a scrub or Mx problem.

Guys we are working hard to get the server running properly with multiple worlds. Sadly we may not be able to do so... if we only have the option for one world would you guys want to keep our old world or start a new realistic biome world? 

You would have to start over from scratch.
If we start a new world I will install silk spawners so you guys could pick up and move mob spawners. 
Please let us know. Your vote counts!! @everyone

I have serious bad news @everyone the old world is gone. In file transfer, I requested a cancellation in the previous server. Well in file transfer last night I got an error and before I could retry the transfer this morning the server was canceled. This is 100% my mistake I should have waited for the transfer to be completed before any cancellation of the previous server. I truly do apologize.

Sabb, it was transferring to his PC from the old server. All it takes is an internet hiccup

That he had yesterday during strean

That could explain it


[26-Nov-19 08:31 AM] MatthewTGM#4058
Exactly, it might be a fault in the old hosts network

I guess I can’t get onto the server for the rest of the night I keep of getting kicked 30 seconds everytime I get on because everything is taking forever to load or appear for me

[27-Nov-19 01:10 AM] CSI_#5031
When I log on it takes like 15 seconds for the world to load around me and another 10-15 second for the welcome back message to pop up than right after that I get kicked, even though it’s saying I have full bars connection wise

@Mortex🇬🇧 boss man, may i recommend allowing the survival world and the spawn world to have inventory synced? Atm when someone joins and they get their starter kit it can't be used in the survival world :pepeJAM:

@Irish Destiny My legs are no longer numb. Being completely honest 1/4 of it I walked. Not because of my lungs but these damn chicken legs! Feels good to wake up and get the run in though, now I am fully awake to work on some special projects!! xD

I used to do cross country and I hated it but it was definitely my peak physical performance. I could run 2 miles (even if it was kinda slow) but now I can’t even do 1 anymore.

I can explain it better if you get on the server


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] account actually dead now#2578
well you need a piston feed tape


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] account actually dead now#2578
3 of them


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] account actually dead now#2578
and a randomizer


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] account actually dead now#2578
shouldnt be that hard


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] TheColdYetCalmIce#5264

[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] account actually dead now#2578
literally all you need is 3 piston feed tapes and 3 randomizers


[22-Dec-19 06:09 PM] Pixell#3985
Loops blocks

For the randomizer you could use dispenser rng


[22-Dec-19 06:10 PM] account actually dead now#2578
yup


[22-Dec-19 06:11 PM] Pixell#3985

@amber Hey Amber, Quackdy is harassing me. He keeps asking me to give him a trident, and I don't have one, nor did I tell anyone I have one. It's really annoying, and I've told him to stop multiple times. Can you please come onto the server and tell him to stop?

[29-Dec-19 04:14 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
@amber hello! somebody thinks it's quite funny to continuously kill our livestock without so much as attempting to breed them. they have recently killed not one, not two, but ALL of our 30 chickens. : ) so if you could check who opened our gate/killed them and ban them, that'd be great. ❤️


[29-Dec-19 04:15 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
if the person doing this is reading this: do me a favor and delete yourself from this server and then uninstall minecraft. have a terrible 2020 and i hope it's spent alone ❤️

look at this sign on our cow farm! because this has happened TWICE before! so not only are you a miserable little cunt who can't even steal cows properly, you're fucking illiterate. proud of you!!

If you are taking wheat from the field please replant

the fact that your own life is so pathetic and uninspired that you keep culling our livestock like a madman is honestly funnier (for me- not you) than any roast i could attempt to create here. anyways ambr will be pulling the plug on you, so read this while you can!

[29-Dec-19 09:27 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

Normally


[29-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
i mean restart command should restart the server right andnot stop?


[29-Dec-19 09:29 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
That’s /refresh or something


[29-Dec-19 09:29 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
as i know on windows (/restart & /stop) stops the server instead of actually restart

[07-Feb-20 11:24 PM] daytonagk#0166

[07-Feb-20 11:25 PM] daytonagk#0166

[08-Feb-20 12:40 PM] ScrubDetector#7361

[09-Feb-20 12:49 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
I can get the stuff back for u @Falconscream


[09-Feb-20 07:48 PM] Litt#9053
How did you loose your stuff @Falconscream? It announces a minute prior and then intervals leading to the drop clear?


[09-Feb-20 07:49 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
@Litt He probably dropped or got killed during the intervals and could not get back to it in time ?


[09-Feb-20 07:50 PM] Litt#9053
Ahhh. If I remove clearlagg I’m disabling a couple of the new enchants cause they create a bigger amount of entities then normal


[09-Feb-20 07:51 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Scrub ain't a fan of clearlag so you have to speak to him


[09-Feb-20 08:34 PM] daytonagk#0166
@Litt like what kind of enchants because depending on the ones there might be a easy solution to the problem I know to do

@deleted-role the mob stacking ruins almost all mob farms and it doesn’t really do it’s job on a small server, I advice removing it *salt* can’t use my gold farm anymore


[16-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
the stacked mobs are good


[16-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
reduces the lag and its okay


[16-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
They aren’t


[16-Feb-20 08:46 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
It doesn’t reduce much lag when there’s few players


[16-Feb-20 08:47 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@Deleted User and it’s not like there is that much lag anymore, they’ve loaded all the chunks so the server should run smoothly with like 15-20 people on


[16-Feb-20 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000

The Mob Stacker will stay till further notice... It does help Reduce lag.. As there some people who like to have ott farms

[17-Feb-20 01:24 AM] Kai#7346
alright, since you guys didn't listen to me while i was in vc


[17-Feb-20 01:25 AM] Kai#7346
scrub said maintenance will take 2 hrs max


[17-Feb-20 01:25 AM] Kai#7346
now, i know it has been over 2 hours, but our dev team is hard at work trying to get the server at its best


[17-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Kai#7346
don't even


[17-Feb-20 01:28 AM] daytonagk#0166
What I wasn’t going to ask for how much longer


[17-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Kai#7346
we will put out an announcement when the server is ready


[17-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Kai#7346
in the mean time please be patient, these things, they take time 😉


[17-Feb-20 01:29 AM] daytonagk#0166
I was going to say thank you for the update why the server is still down and thank you for trying your best to get all the bugs out of ther


[17-Feb-20 01:29 AM] Kai#7346
ok, sorry for snapping


[17-Feb-20 01:29 AM] daytonagk#0166

Maintenance? :Weirdchamp:


[17-Feb-20 03:26 AM] Kai#7346
i have not been given any updates. Any updates made on server status will be done by a developer


[17-Feb-20 03:27 AM] aryn#3412
I not waking up date just wanted to know if u giys doing ok since it started


[17-Feb-20 05:17 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@deleted-role just a reminder to enable tnt use in nether


[17-Feb-20 05:17 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
While maintenance is on


[17-Feb-20 05:17 AM] Kai#7346
i will pass that on to the developers


[17-Feb-20 05:18 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Ok 🙂


[17-Feb-20 05:18 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
It’ll make it so it’s easier to break the bedrock roof in the nether


[17-Feb-20 05:18 AM] Kai#7346
i imagine that tnt permissions could be done without the server going down, so i will talk to aj about it tomorrow


[17-Feb-20 05:18 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Isn’t the server in maintenance currently?


[17-Feb-20 05:19 AM] Kai#7346
it is, but the moderation team has no hand in what goes on during maintenance


[17-Feb-20 05:19 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Oh ok, soz


[17-Feb-20 05:19 AM] Kai#7346
it's ok 🙂


[17-Feb-20 05:19 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854

[17-Feb-20 07:46 AM] Nia#6083
good morning scrubby 😉


[17-Feb-20 07:46 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Hai!! 😂


[17-Feb-20 07:48 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
As soon as we can get the server back running we will. Issues have arrived that are unexplained via the console. Apologies for the unexpected delay, but things will be back up and running ASAP.


[17-Feb-20 07:54 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector btw, remember to allow tnt usage in nether


[17-Feb-20 08:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Don’t Censor Hentai why in the nether btw?


[17-Feb-20 08:03 AM] daytonagk#0166
So we can break the nether roof


[17-Feb-20 08:03 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Why would you wan't to build above the nether ?


[17-Feb-20 08:04 AM] daytonagk#0166
For a good farm


[17-Feb-20 08:04 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
if thats what your trying to say


[17-Feb-20 08:04 AM] daytonagk#0166
Gold not good


[17-Feb-20 08:04 AM] daytonagk#0166
Mortex


[17-Feb-20 08:05 AM] daytonagk#0166
So let’s say I log in and die from water damage will I get a /back because I died right when I logged in


[17-Feb-20 08:06 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
You're asking the wrong person.. We only doing what scrub wants us to do.


[17-Feb-20 08:07 AM] daytonagk#0166
Ok just wondering since idk if I’ll die when I log in because I disconnected under water and I’m just really worried


[17-Feb-20 08:07 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector so people can break the bedrock roof


[17-Feb-20 08:07 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Easily


[17-Feb-20 08:08 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@Mortex🇬🇧 people want to build on the nether roof to make gold farms.


[17-Feb-20 08:08 AM] daytonagk#0166
@Don’t Censor Hentai I have already told them that


[17-Feb-20 08:08 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@daytonagk yeah, just saw


[17-Feb-20 08:09 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Gold farms seem look a good way for entity lag


[17-Feb-20 08:09 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@daytonagk you can currently break bedrock with tnt minecarts but it’s much slower


[17-Feb-20 08:09 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector nah, the pigmen stack


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
and die


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
lol


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] Nightbot#0001
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] daytonagk#0166
That’s true that means it shouldn’t lag


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Just don’t make an xp farm out of it.


[17-Feb-20 08:10 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Well, the server didn’t run any worse yesterday when I used it and it’s not like people are gonna use gold farms 24/7


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
XP Farms made either way would be stacked ?


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Xp + gold farms are really shit


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
unlikely people will make those


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Perhaps but im not sure how it works. Something is still tracking how many mobs


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Happened last server


[17-Feb-20 08:11 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
takes way more effort than enderman farms or zombie/skeleton farms


[17-Feb-20 08:12 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector the mob cap is always filled, +70 mobs to the mob cap every player online, the only way to make mob lag is with spawners


[17-Feb-20 08:13 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Gold farms don’t cause entity lag unless you vount the items


[17-Feb-20 08:14 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector in 1.14.4 mob optimization was super bad, it’s probably not a problem anymore


[17-Feb-20 08:14 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
You should wait and see how it goes, then decide if you wanna ban gold farms or not


[17-Feb-20 08:15 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I decreased the mob cap.


[17-Feb-20 08:15 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
iirc


[17-Feb-20 08:22 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Ok


[17-Feb-20 08:33 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854

[17-Feb-20 04:40 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Yeah sadly I haven't touched any of that.. I was Informed you was hiding 3 spawners and I came online to investigate.


[17-Feb-20 07:45 PM] B_Rob20#5149
@kingyaya52 yo I noticed youve claimed land next to mine in the server


[17-Feb-20 07:46 PM] B_Rob20#5149

[17-Feb-20 10:29 PM] daytonagk#0166

[18-Feb-20 05:41 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
The server is currently in maintenance for about an hour due to a reason.. I'll keep you guys updated.

[18-Feb-20 10:43 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
I thought you removed villager stacking


[18-Feb-20 10:47 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
all 5 of those were cured and it took me like 3 hours to get them


[18-Feb-20 10:49 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Don’t Censor Hentai we stacked them again because of the lag on the server


[18-Feb-20 10:49 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Villagers are one of the main entities causing lag on the server


[18-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
well, now 9 hours of my life got wasted


[18-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
there is a plugin that limits the amount of villagers in the area


[18-Feb-20 10:52 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
stacking villagers is the worst way to fix this, now literally everything to do with villagers is useless


[18-Feb-20 10:52 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
my iron farm is now broken


[18-Feb-20 10:54 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
and if villagers are a cause of lag won't the shop plugin lag the server to hell?


[18-Feb-20 11:00 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector possible other solutions to villager lag: remove most villager ai and limit amount of villagers in an area


[18-Feb-20 11:02 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Don’t Censor Hentai we will be looking into it, for sure. Give me some time, as I am talking to my server host at the moment


[18-Feb-20 11:02 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
ok


[18-Feb-20 11:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Can you unmute me?


[18-Feb-20 11:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Everyone has a go at me for an opinion


[18-Feb-20 11:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'm the only one being insulted


[18-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
And then I'm the only one who gets muted??


[18-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Anyone want to explain that?


[18-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854

[18-Feb-20 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I literally voiced one opinion about the villager issue that guy was talking about


[18-Feb-20 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
And like 4 people jumped at me


[18-Feb-20 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
And then I try to defend against all these people actively having a go at me


[18-Feb-20 11:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
And I get muted


[18-Feb-20 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I wasn't even trying to have an argument I was just trying to understand why he was so worked up about villagers


[18-Feb-20 11:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
You all didn't have to basically call me stupid for not knowing and then mute me


[18-Feb-20 11:28 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@Deleted User they muted you because you kept going after being told to stop and you kept insisting on knowing something even though you'd barely heard about it


[18-Feb-20 11:36 AM] daytonagk#0166
@Deleted User ya if you keep going on after being told to stop thats the fastest way to get muted


[18-Feb-20 11:47 AM] YaBoyRobin#4702
Aight lets break up this dumbass fight


[18-Feb-20 11:48 AM] Nia#6083
Arguing in the MC server will not be tolerated by anyone. If you have a problem with someone, PLEASE, discuss your differences in discord VA private msg. Thank you #ScrubFam

@ScrubDetector we should have a mining comp adn its where everyone gets a silk toch pic and everyone gos mining for said time and then each ore is a certain amount of points and i thing it would be fun and the winner gets all the ores but if you want you can do what ever


[21-Feb-20 10:20 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@daytonagk ya we have actually done those in the past, I’m down!

Be able to make the judgment day?


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] daytonagk#0166
you should see at adding a plugin where if you kill the ender dragon you can get a elytra since the end cities will be raided with in days of the dragon kill and also add one to make it where shulkers have a 100% chance to drop 2 shells for the same reason


[21-Feb-20 10:23 AM] daytonagk#0166
no but i will be on for like 2 hours befor i have to leave for work today so if you wqant i can get a little clip of my stuff and send it to you  or get a staff member to get a home set for my base


[21-Feb-20 10:24 AM] daytonagk#0166
i work from 10 to 6 on sunday and saterday so ya


[21-Feb-20 10:25 AM] daytonagk#0166
but if the comp is after that ill mabey be able to make it if my parents dont have plans


[21-Feb-20 10:28 AM] daytonagk#0166
which would you rather want a clip of my base or a staff member have a home set at my base for you to get to my base

@daytonagk the end won’t be preloaded and I’m pretty sure there won’t be a world border, if you go far enough you’ll definetly find end cities

If the server don't respond or it's powered off then its fine to do so..

@aryn pls @ mderators for small problems like that


[24-Feb-20 04:52 PM] aryn#3412
@OnlyAPenguin I don't think that's a. "Small" problem


[24-Feb-20 05:18 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
@aryn It is a small problem which a minecraft moderator can resolve as they have the ability to.. If it's server related then the mods will inform the admins so we can have a lookinto it.


[24-Feb-20 05:19 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I mean there really no point having roles if your going to keep informing higher role people

[26-Feb-20 10:55 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
i only have one villager in it now, the other one got killed by skeletons, but i couldn't make them breed at all no matter how hard i tried. there were enough beds, i'd traded with them both, they had 10 bread each


[26-Feb-20 10:55 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
but they'd make hearts and just...nothing. no babies


[26-Feb-20 10:56 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
could i please have a villager spawn egg/have someone spawn another in? : ( i'm just bummed out because my villagers just seem/seemed bugged

@kit-kaboodii give them a stack of carrots and they’ll breed like crazy 10 bread isn’t enough


[26-Feb-20 11:01 AM] kit-kaboodii#6407
they have enough, they make hearts so they're willing, but no babies


[26-Feb-20 11:06 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
@daytonagk Dayton u can’t just build a community farm and then exclude a couple people


[26-Feb-20 11:07 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
And u especially can’t say that we should kill them if we see them at the farm

We just don't have a vaccine, if any person thats not elderly, pregnant or has their immunesystem lowered in any way, you'll survive... Don't get me wrong, you'll be very ill, but you'll statistically be fine 🤷🏼‍♂️

@amber would you like to travle 5k blocks for a shop tell me


[03-Mar-20 09:58 PM] amber#2184

[03-Mar-20 09:58 PM] amber#2184

@Kai are you able to get on and say if this looks ugly


[03-Mar-20 09:59 PM] amber#2184

[03-Mar-20 11:04 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@daytonagk the problem was not that you had shops on the water the problem was you had a building right next to spawn. No one can build close to spawn period. And if you keep hounding my staff after they tell you something then maybe you should talk to me.


[03-Mar-20 11:05 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
You can’t get higher up then me. So your shop has to be moved. Sorry.


[03-Mar-20 11:06 PM] Cartplayz#0138
@daytonagk you got a problem with the staff?

[05-Mar-20 10:42 AM] daytonagk#0166
@ScrubDetector the reason why i was getting mad was because there was no rules against it on /rules so i thout they were making up rules


[05-Mar-20 10:43 AM] daytonagk#0166
anyone want to help get this mob farm up and running?


[05-Mar-20 10:52 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@daytonagk can you typically fly in survival? Or x ray in survival? Is it a minecraft feature


[05-Mar-20 10:52 AM] daytonagk#0166
no but what does that have to do with making a shop on the water near the spawn or making a mob farm?


[05-Mar-20 10:54 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
/rules have not been setup... Always check the rules at spawn


[05-Mar-20 10:54 AM] daytonagk#0166
ok i will

Also if you guys just look up griefing wait I did it for you.
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game (trolling)

there have been zombies spawning in the nether on nonspawnable blocks and if it could be fixed please that would be great


[19-Mar-20 01:31 AM] Litt#9053
Been in the nether now 5 minutes flying around. Went through atleast 20 chunks and saw no zombies. Probably a nearby portal that is doing that. Nothing I can do about that, unfortunately that comes with the game.


[19-Mar-20 12:44 PM] daytonagk#0166
well heres the thing aj there was a zombie on a spot where there was no possableility for it being there no portals around no blocks to the bock it was on ands alsoo it was on a glass block so ya


[19-Mar-20 02:17 PM] Litt#9053

Because he doesn't want to restock don't mean it had to be removed.

then whats the purpose of it being there]

He will restock it in his own time and not when you want him to.

I already explained why the zombies are spawning, but i guess you forgot, so that's whatever. As a result, this boy is gonna be in a bit of trouble if he doesn't turn around~

Mortex I have a idea for scrubs stream when he’s streaming Minecraft


[22-Mar-20 06:00 PM] Timotainment#4596
epic


[22-Mar-20 06:00 PM] daytonagk#0166
It will display follow scrub and subscribe to


[22-Mar-20 06:01 PM] daytonagk#0166
To everyone on the server who ncluding him when he right clicks a sighn


[22-Mar-20 06:01 PM] daytonagk#0166
@amber like my idea?


[22-Mar-20 06:10 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Why signs


[22-Mar-20 06:43 PM] daytonagk#0166
Because there’s a command that can make it where when you right click a sighn it does a command


[22-Mar-20 06:43 PM] daytonagk#0166
Just a idea

why does it take to extend the bourder


[23-Mar-20 08:10 PM] daytonagk#0166
theres only 1 command you need to do to expand the bourder


[23-Mar-20 08:12 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@daytonagk as I told you on the server. I am using a plugin to generate all the chunks in a 20,000 block radius. Why? Because then we won’t have to deal with chunk rendering issues on the server


[23-Mar-20 08:16 PM] daytonagk#0166
toh ok


[23-Mar-20 08:22 PM] daytonagk#0166
i have never heard of that thing being a plugin


[23-Mar-20 08:23 PM] Litt#9053
You’ve probably never heard of a couple of the plugins we used due to the fact a decent amount are custom plugins that require you to buy them


[23-Mar-20 08:33 PM] daytonagk#0166
OH


[23-Mar-20 08:35 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Dude I would stop questioning about server work because it seems like your inexperienced in the whole section and should only be left to people who know how to do stuff.


[23-Mar-20 08:42 PM] daytonagk#0166
well i was wondering why you not just do the command because i never have heard of a plugin to do that


[23-Mar-20 08:42 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
No worries.


[23-Mar-20 08:43 PM] daytonagk#0166
the only thing im not happy about is that i cant afk fish over night because of it


[23-Mar-20 08:44 PM] daytonagk#0166

oh i forgot to ask


[23-Mar-20 08:44 PM] daytonagk#0166
what mods do you allow on the server i know jei is allowed what others are allowed


[23-Mar-20 08:45 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
It's only one night.. It's not going to be the end of the world.


[23-Mar-20 08:45 PM] daytonagk#0166

[23-Mar-20 08:46 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
That’s it


[23-Mar-20 08:46 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
We used to allow fabric but only on special permission


[23-Mar-20 08:46 PM] daytonagk#0166
whats that


[23-Mar-20 08:46 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I'm not trying to sound like a cunt even though people may think I am but all I'm saying is chill and relax and play a different game till the server is operational again.


[23-Mar-20 08:47 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
It’s used to run clients such as wurst

Last night I woke up today to see I was kicked for no afk fishing


[26-Mar-20 07:35 AM] daytonagk#0166
I was overnight afk fishing


[26-Mar-20 07:35 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

I know it was in the past 6 hours tho because I set up my thing at midnight and woke up at6:30 and thank you man I was hoping to get some good loot from it but I guess the dude that kicked me hates afk fishing


[26-Mar-20 07:37 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Tbh I don't even know the rules with afk fishing if it's allowed or not


[26-Mar-20 07:37 AM] daytonagk#0166
It is aloud scrub said that it is


[26-Mar-20 07:38 AM] daytonagk#0166
We have asked him many times


[26-Mar-20 07:38 AM] daytonagk#0166
And op has been a jerk about afk fishing farms because he thought they weren’t aloud


[26-Mar-20 08:09 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

@ScrubDetector, Are you going to add Auctions? or will it be the same server, same plugins?


[30-Mar-20 02:02 PM] daytonagk#0166
There needs to be villagers


[30-Mar-20 02:02 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
no auctions but server shops that do the same thing


[30-Mar-20 02:03 PM] daytonagk#0166
And villagers


[30-Mar-20 02:03 PM] ScrubDetector#7361

How will we get weakness potions if the never will be closed


[30-Mar-20 02:08 PM] daytonagk#0166
We need blaze rods


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] daytonagk#0166
OH


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] Timotainment#4596
bruh


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] daytonagk#0166
who has a server of there own?


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] Timotainment#4596
i dont


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] Timotainment#4596
just spend some money to buy it


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] Timotainment#4596
its hard af to run a server though


[30-Mar-20 02:09 PM] daytonagk#0166
We should have a snapshot world for people to test stuff befor 1.16 to come out


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] Timotainment#4596
thats too risky


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] daytonagk#0166
No it’s not I have done it


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] Timotainment#4596
theyt said it before. snapshot servers are risky


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] daytonagk#0166
The server foster I used was free


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] daytonagk#0166
All I had to do was make sure to reset the timer


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] Timotainment#4596
there was too many bugs to run a big server like the scrub server


[30-Mar-20 02:10 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Snapshots servers and plugins dont mix well


[30-Mar-20 02:11 PM] daytonagk#0166
Well then if you can find a plotworld snapshot plugin that would be awsome


[30-Mar-20 02:50 PM] account actually dead now#2578
what happened to the server


[30-Mar-20 02:50 PM] daytonagk#0166

[30-Mar-20 02:50 PM] account actually dead now#2578

If someone can buy a server for scrub to where we can keep the old world please speak up I really want to keep it


[30-Mar-20 07:53 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Why not just download the world and run it as a local one 🙂


[30-Mar-20 07:53 PM] daytonagk#0166
Um


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Good question i know!


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] daytonagk#0166
Local won’t help me if I have friends from different states


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] daytonagk#0166
Ok then how


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Local = Port forward so friends can use via your own ip if wanted.


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] daytonagk#0166
um


[30-Mar-20 07:54 PM] daytonagk#0166
That’s so stinking risky


[30-Mar-20 07:55 PM] daytonagk#0166
And second of all local is only for people connected to your WiFi


[30-Mar-20 07:55 PM] daytonagk#0166
Not for everyone in the world


[30-Mar-20 08:03 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Alright i'm just going to pretend i did not see that.


[30-Mar-20 08:12 PM] daytonagk#0166
Hey it’s true tho


[30-Mar-20 08:19 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

But ok

I heard Command blocks are the best for hosting the world but i don't know how to work


[30-Mar-20 08:44 PM] daytonagk#0166
Command blocks are for commands


[30-Mar-20 08:45 PM] Sonic21fan#3808
they control like weather and time and they can control how to build stuff and all that but with commands ive used them before but i dont think they are needed

@daytonagk  you can host a server on your own pc (better if you have a good pc)
but then you can port forward or use a vpn to get people to play on that server


[31-Mar-20 02:44 PM] Maik#4502
I've done it multiple times


[31-Mar-20 04:01 PM] daytonagk#0166
@Maik dude did you now know i play on a laptop


[31-Mar-20 07:55 PM] daytonagk#0166
i think the server is down


[31-Mar-20 07:59 PM] daytonagk#0166
@Don’t Censor Hentai since you dont play on the server and the server is restarting can i use your iron farm to do something amazing


[31-Mar-20 08:00 PM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854

I leveled up my pickaxe to level 4 and didn’t get any tokens nor any enchantments in prison, is that intentional?


[15-Apr-20 08:09 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Only oak wood increases the experience of axes, need to fix that

[15-Apr-20 08:33 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Also, the clear lag removes all entities including hopper minecarts, so that means that there’s no way to keep up with the smelting speed of the  max level blast furnace, hoppers are too slow for that


[15-Apr-20 08:51 AM] Litt#9053
Random chance of getting tokens or money on pickaxes. Axes shouldn't even get experience, I will be disabling that. You can still upgrade your axe with /upgrade

Will be fixing the clear lagg. Thank you for letting me know all this, it does help!

@Don’t Censor Hentai 

Let me know if you come across any other bugs.

People getting burned out already?


[17-Apr-20 02:59 PM] FL4SHPO1NT#6020
Player counts have been looking a little low lately.


[17-Apr-20 03:02 PM] Reyz#8406
Nah, just been a lot of server work the last couple of days. I'm sure once everything is finalized and Scrub streams a bit on it, it'll get busy again.


[17-Apr-20 03:02 PM] Reyz#8406
(That and for me, it was spring break for me last week lol)


[17-Apr-20 03:05 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
When the server starts fresh the player high count his amazing over a period of time people stop playing


[17-Apr-20 03:06 PM] Reyz#8406
That does make sense.


[17-Apr-20 03:07 PM] FL4SHPO1NT#6020
Yeah i've seen that alot on all servers. I'm just a building kind of person. So early grind is just a means to get there for me.


[17-Apr-20 03:08 PM] FL4SHPO1NT#6020
We over at Moldihr have a very large build in the process that we hope the whole server can enjoy. Just skeptical about putting the time in with such low numbers


[17-Apr-20 06:08 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726
nooooo


[17-Apr-20 06:08 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726

We need to plan an event soon then.


[17-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Reyz#8406
Like a PvP or a spleef event, so people will join.


[17-Apr-20 06:54 PM] Reyz#8406
I'm sure we could set one up in the survival world


[17-Apr-20 07:57 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726
doesnt even have to be official


[17-Apr-20 07:57 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726
we can make one ourselves


[17-Apr-20 07:57 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726
I'd be down


[17-Apr-20 08:07 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Sorry guys I’ll definitely be on more!! Not feeling to great today, but I have some really cool ideas and pranks to do!!

nev


[24-Apr-20 12:31 AM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
@oreo Yes, be careful with carpet in your base. It happened to me on a previous server. Sorry for the delayed response. Let us know if there's something we can do to help.


[24-Apr-20 02:13 AM] daytonagk#0166
@🎃Justin Andrew🎃 what happend?


[24-Apr-20 02:22 AM] 🎃Justin Andrew🎃#1749
Idk, I'm guessing he fell through the floor. If you place carpet inside your home (Or where ever your three homes are set) It'll often times lag you through the floor, causing you to lose everything on you.  Try to only use carpets in areas that aren't home teleports.


[24-Apr-20 03:21 AM] oreo#8182
i was just asking if that glitch still exists


[24-Apr-20 03:22 AM] oreo#8182
since ive fell through it like a few months back


[24-Apr-20 03:44 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@oreo yes it’s just a weird glitch with the plugin.


[24-Apr-20 03:45 AM] oreo#8182
btw scrub


[24-Apr-20 03:45 AM] oreo#8182
could i open a shop in ur land?


[24-Apr-20 03:45 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Maybe in the future


[24-Apr-20 03:45 AM] oreo#8182
i will sell gravel and holy sand


[24-Apr-20 03:46 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Lmao, how bout this, I’ll buy 2 double chests of both for.... 400$??


[24-Apr-20 03:46 AM] oreo#8182
i dont have that much gravel rn


[24-Apr-20 03:47 AM] oreo#8182
ill grind a bunch of gravel today


[24-Apr-20 03:47 AM] oreo#8182
i only started my gravel career this morning


[24-Apr-20 03:47 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Ok, I need dark oak as well


[24-Apr-20 03:47 AM] ScrubDetector#7361

[24-Apr-20 03:48 AM] oreo#8182
if you'll ever need grinding materials, ask me. all the common and uncommon biomes are beside shurima


[24-Apr-20 03:49 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Sounds good, I enjoy grinding myself... but I’ve been building like crazy. So many mats


[24-Apr-20 03:49 AM] oreo#8182
ikr, grinding sand is pretty peaceful ngl


[24-Apr-20 03:53 AM] oreo#8182
althought its the most tedious money making scheme


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] oreo#8182
takes 2 diamond shovels to mine out a full double chest, sell them for like 5 diamonds


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] oreo#8182
and then u gain +3 diamonds


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] Maik#4502
Just use mending man


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] Maik#4502
And then just dont break the shovel


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] Maik#4502
And repair


[24-Apr-20 03:54 AM] Maik#4502

[27-Apr-20 10:02 AM] 𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈#5485
1 can’t visit others plot 
2 can’t level up picks other than legendary picks
3 you can upgrade other people’s furnaces 
4. Tips say do /kits but you can’t 
5 not possible to get scrub keys


[27-Apr-20 10:06 AM] 𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈#5485
There is also no /shop for plot decoration


[27-Apr-20 10:21 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈ he's implementing the shop so that's no problem


[27-Apr-20 10:23 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Though, the bug that needs the most fixing rn is prices, redstone is worth less than coal and emeralds are worth less than iron blocks, I think either you should increase the price of emeralds so they're worth more than iron blocks or increase the amount of emeralds in mines like I and J


[27-Apr-20 10:23 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@Litt


[27-Apr-20 10:24 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
Btw also increase gold price to about 20% more than iron, maybe increase price to rankup in later mines to balance things out


[27-Apr-20 11:10 AM] Nordic#1337
@Litt  you going to prison bud?

Just because the bugs are there doesnt you should use them and that we have to fix them right away

Hey quick question for you peoples,what benefits do we get from the sub rank in the server?


[08-May-20 05:25 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
You get the /ec cmd and /craft. You also might get some additional things coming in.  A sub is really more to support the stream but you do get some small tools to help improve ur experience.


[08-May-20 05:28 PM] CascadeOX#4441
ok cool

So I kinda found a ton of glitches with the “pre” optifine build. And after using it for so long I took it off and god my game just ran so much better. The new optifine is not working great, including things like lagging on chunk borders, also breaking crops and entities just felt clunky.

Long story short I will not be using shaders on the channel until optifine fixes some of their issues

I am kinda confused bc my times are different than the americcan times


[19-Jun-20 03:02 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
What time zone are you in?


[19-Jun-20 03:03 AM] Maik#4502
Well that is 5 am for me


[19-Jun-20 03:03 AM] Maik#4502
So i cant play when the server starts for the first time


[19-Jun-20 03:04 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
It’s okay! Not much progress will be made in the first day, and I’m sure plenty of people will still be on by the evening time for you! You’ll be able to join into everyone still!


[19-Jun-20 03:05 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
It’s a very grindy thing so you’ll still be on the same level as most people! I myself won’t be able to play when it first opens either!


[19-Jun-20 03:12 AM] Maik#4502
Should i try to speedrun The day i can come online?


[19-Jun-20 03:56 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
You don't have to speed run! Just have fun!


[19-Jun-20 10:27 AM] greensandwhichmaster#3726

[22-Jun-20 06:49 PM] James#0007
"a dev took our diaminds because we have screen shots of one of your members with an xray client" is the right quote


[22-Jun-20 06:49 PM] greensandwhichmaster#3726

[22-Jun-20 07:01 PM] Oceano#9552
Well i had an xray client that i was using fullbright for. I didnt even have keybinds set up


[22-Jun-20 07:18 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
U can turn fullbright on through java.txt


[22-Jun-20 07:19 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
options.txt*


[22-Jun-20 07:19 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
you can set your gama up


[22-Jun-20 07:20 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
which client was it?


[22-Jun-20 07:20 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
@Oceano


[22-Jun-20 07:21 PM] Oceano#9552
Idk which one it was some random xray client that i got a long time ago to use on my survival maps. Now i got a texture pack with fullbright.


[22-Jun-20 07:23 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
you can also just do it through the minecraft folder


[22-Jun-20 07:23 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
go to minecraft folder


[22-Jun-20 07:23 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
options.txt


[22-Jun-20 07:23 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
and change ur gama to 999


[22-Jun-20 07:24 PM] Oceano#9552
Yeah i might do that since i like the normal textures more. Thanks for the help 🙂


[22-Jun-20 07:24 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823

[23-Jun-20 08:54 AM] nuggie#7574
il pretty sure that all automatic farms are allowed


[23-Jun-20 08:54 AM] nuggie#7574
but maybe not fish farms


[23-Jun-20 08:55 AM] Oceano#9552
yeah probably.


[23-Jun-20 08:56 AM] nuggie#7574
but maybe someone who is more involved with the minecraft server can answer that later

[25-Jun-20 11:23 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
Guys we’re incredibly sorry. We just started a new server and it’s going to take us a little bit of time to get everything organized and under control. We promise this won’t be a continuous thing!!! We hope that you’ll continue to enjoy the server with us!


[25-Jun-20 11:31 AM] MerlinDaSkeley#1559
a new server?


[25-Jun-20 11:31 AM] MerlinDaSkeley#1559

It’s alright


[25-Jun-20 11:36 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
That’s alright, but no we just restarted the server this past weekend


[25-Jun-20 11:40 AM] Reyz#8406 (pinned)
Most (if not all) of the people helping to run the server aren’t getting paid to run the server. They are sacrificing their own time and energy to give everyone here an enjoyable experience, and with all of the add-ins and such, it makes it tougher to get the server running. So give them patience, as things can change with new updates to Minecraft. And be thankful that you have a practically-free server that you can play on.


[25-Jun-20 11:41 AM] Kai#7346
Pinned a message.


[25-Jun-20 11:41 AM] awkward one#7761
ya its ok im not sad or upset about this it was just suprising


[25-Jun-20 11:42 AM] Reyz#8406
Yeah of course! While hacking and griefing doesn’t seem like it’s allowed on the server, it seems like they have workarounds for when it does happen. Doesn’t give you an excuse to do so, though.


[25-Jun-20 11:43 AM] Reyz#8406
But it is cool that they can revert a grief. They did that for my base.


[25-Jun-20 11:43 AM] awkward one#7761

[26-Jun-20 04:21 AM] Its_Jepoan#3994
Will the server update to 1.16?


[26-Jun-20 04:31 AM] asspecto#4943
They already updated it


[26-Jun-20 04:42 AM] James#0007
Nope still 1.15 we'll upgrade as soon as all the plugins update


[26-Jun-20 06:29 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Most plugins are updated and compatible  though


[26-Jun-20 08:53 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
most plugins might but thats not all. Spigot has warned anyone from upgrading that there can be many issues

Hey, @Reyz !

I'd like to dive deeper into this issue, can you provide some more details...
Are they respawning after explosions?
Or just after you break a block?

Thank you!

After explosion @Litt


[03-Jul-20 03:38 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
He was using the bed method to mine a ancient debri, same thing happened to me


[03-Jul-20 03:39 AM] Litt#9053
I see...

You can thank Towny for that one.
It rebuilds terrain thats been destroyed by explosions.

@Litt  

Yes, what Kaly said. As I was placing a bed down in the nether to collect ancient debris, the blocks quickly responded, which almost killed me. I’m curious if maybe the respawn time could be reduced or something?


[03-Jul-20 03:38 PM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@OnlyAPenguin  yes, CUM


[03-Jul-20 03:43 PM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
Nice


[03-Jul-20 06:10 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
👌


[04-Jul-20 02:57 AM] Litt#9053
@Reyz 

Id have to completely disable the option of explosions being regenerated. Up to @ScrubDetector at that point. 😄


[04-Jul-20 02:57 AM] Litt#9053
On another note - Theres a release of Optifine for 1.16 out! ❤️


[04-Jul-20 03:22 AM] Litt#9053
It's a proper feature in Towny, Scrub and I kept it enabled. We can change the delay to test out? Up to you guys, I don't mind.

Aha I see just mention cause I remeber when we had 1.14 running there was points where blocks would regen but nevermind.


[04-Jul-20 03:24 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Just to note I didn't know I was editing my own message 🙄


[04-Jul-20 03:25 AM] Litt#9053
no worries, its def an interesting feature


[04-Jul-20 03:28 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Do ores regen after a period of time?


[04-Jul-20 03:30 AM] Litt#9053
just mob explosions


[04-Jul-20 03:30 AM] Litt#9053
and maybe bed explosions


[04-Jul-20 03:30 AM] Litt#9053
cuz im guessing they register as a creeper explosion or somethin


[04-Jul-20 03:32 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Aha I see very nice.


[04-Jul-20 06:13 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Litt it would be nice to disable per “world” aka only regen in the overworld


[04-Jul-20 06:13 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
If not possible, we could disable it


[04-Jul-20 06:14 AM] Piss Baby#9659

@Litt  I'm sorry I'm messaging you like this but I can't message you directly. MrScrubDetector told me to talk to you about being unbanned from Hardcore. The Tickets weren't working for me yesterday and I didn't get an unban. My minecraft username is: AtomicComet123

[07-Jul-20 04:06 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@greensandwhichmaster buckets of lavas are disabled for griefing reasons and killing other players. It has zero to do with being good or bad at the game and I have no idea what that would have to do with that function.


[07-Jul-20 08:49 AM] greensandwhichmaster#3726
Alright


[07-Jul-20 09:58 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
concerning the announcement that there won't be respawns in hardcore anymore, does that mean if you die the message that says you will be unbanned in 24 hours won't show up?


[07-Jul-20 11:53 AM] allstar1005#0575
I doubt it but honestly have no clue


[07-Jul-20 11:53 AM] allstar1005#0575
Should still be a three day ban


[07-Jul-20 01:04 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
No it means no early revives, unless they use channel points

@certyjuga please make a ticket and don’t bring that talk into discord channels. We can very easily role things back and / or ban whoever did this.

[25-Sep-20 12:40 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@daytonagk I’m going to bed now. But the situation can’t happen again. We used to have a protection in place for this but we forgot to add in when we switched worlds. Just bad luck if I’m being honest.


[25-Sep-20 01:03 AM] daytonagk#0166
I litterly got banned from a Minecraft discord server because I made a ticket to warn them about the hacker and didn’t have my account linked to Minecraft


[25-Sep-20 07:45 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
What happened ?


[25-Sep-20 08:23 AM] Photoshopfreak#3157
Some idiot went on the server last night and messed stuff up. Just a person with no life. He / she also makes YT videos of themselves going onto different servers and destroying everything.


[25-Sep-20 08:27 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Yeah I've read the chat and seen the youtube video... It happened before similar when i was deving.


[25-Sep-20 08:27 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Not much we can do apart from moving on from it and hope it don't happens again

Your ticket people know we have lives right and can't get back to then straight away? So closing the ticket prematurely is BS.


[03-Oct-20 01:04 AM] nuggie#7574
What’s wrong did something happen?


[03-Oct-20 04:58 AM] CJFaerie#6258
Yeah. Got some crap advice about fixing something (that wouldn't fix it, as they had already been told) and then the ticket was closed.

:vvDerp:


[03-Oct-20 06:16 PM] queencactu#1350
so /sethome and sleeping in a bed are different. you can have 2 homes /home or /home bed


[03-Oct-20 06:17 PM] queencactu#1350
sleeping in a bed set the bed spawn and /sethome sets home home

[04-Oct-20 10:08 AM] OANE#1489
wdym


[04-Oct-20 10:08 AM] The Major#1663
i said i got banned for ddosing, that doesn't mean i did it, damn

> nah, i got banned for ddosing the server XD
@The Major


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
:rooBlankBlink:


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] OANE#1489
so you got banned but you didnt do it?


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] OANE#1489
well i am sorry than


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] The Major#1663
again, i said i got banned for "ddosing the server" that doesn't mean i did it


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] OANE#1489
yeah but y you got banned than?


[04-Oct-20 10:09 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
i mean you can ask a mod why you got banned


[04-Oct-20 10:10 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
take from peoples chests or griefing maybe?


[04-Oct-20 10:10 AM] The Major#1663
because i said "rip server" when the server went down


[04-Oct-20 10:12 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
maybe you could talk to nia about it in discord chat


[04-Oct-20 10:12 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
maybe she can figure out why


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] The Major#1663
Nah, i don't play minecraft


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
becuase that seems like a stupid reason to get banned


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] The Major#1663
it doesn't really matter


[04-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913

Open your resource pack folder from inside minecraft


[05-Oct-20 02:24 PM] CommunistBean#8354
Right click on the texturepack that doesnt work/you want to delete.


[05-Oct-20 02:24 PM] CommunistBean#8354
Press "delete/remove"


[05-Oct-20 02:25 PM] CommunistBean#8354
then enter your trashbin/trashcan


[05-Oct-20 02:25 PM] CommunistBean#8354
and clear the trash can by right clicking on the empty spot and clicking "empty recyclebin" and when it asks you to confirm it press "yes"


[05-Oct-20 02:26 PM] CommunistBean#8354
now it should be gone from your whole pc

i think that's actually the game not being able to load chunks that far


[06-Oct-20 10:52 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
when they removed the far lands  it didnt fix anything so the farther you got out the more buggy the land,water and lava gets

it is random

so you will get random tps and sometimes you'll either be really far away or really close

anyone else have it so that you can't join with different computers from the same ip address?


[09-Oct-20 10:29 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I assume it's the way security is setup.


[09-Oct-20 10:29 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
One device from the same ip that's linked to that account


[09-Oct-20 10:30 PM] Tiffany#4316
😦 It makes it so that I can't play with my brother-in-law at his place


[09-Oct-20 10:30 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
If you're accessing it from a different location then this I assume will happen.


[09-Oct-20 10:31 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
If you make a ticket and get litt to fix it I'm sure he be happy to edit a few settings when he is free 😊


[09-Oct-20 10:31 PM] Tiffany#4316
I did make a ticket, yet I understand it is very late probably for him, thank you for responding though.


[09-Oct-20 10:32 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
I mean normally you can just message him in dm and he comes online pretty quick. But no worries. hopefully, it can be fixed soon.and you can get back to playing on the server.


[09-Oct-20 10:33 PM] Tiffany#4316

[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
because you can firework with an elytra passed the height limit and it keeps going


[10-Oct-20 06:12 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
no sky void or anything like the bottom the map has so it just lets you keep going up


[10-Oct-20 07:06 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I think you have to render more the higher it is. I would assume

[11-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Dirty Dan#9475
just an idea but can we maybe get a /shop for building blocks and stuff because gathering all blocks is a pain in the back and like a sell/buy option so you can get maybe like $100 for a stack of cobble

Okay peeps, the more that I think about it the more I wanna do a restart, I am bored out of my mind on the server, and so are many others. when we do restart, I think it'd be best if we just make a small lil town that we all work on together if you'd all like, that way scrub has a place for all newbies and they don't come harass us.


[25-Oct-20 01:31 PM] OANE#1489
wdym town with all the people or just groups of people


[25-Oct-20 01:32 PM] Tiffany#4316
I mean for like starter homes, like subdivide a claim, and then peeps can have their homes there until they are geared enough to go out further

@Tiffany that is not really fair because better players get better gear and get to make all the decisions. like how players in full enchanted/netherite complained that the mobs are too easy, and scrub made them harder and more frequent. which is harder for newer players who get killed whenever they try to leave a safe space. like me, who had a full enchanted netherite sword and still gets killed when i try to explore.


[25-Oct-20 06:47 PM] Tiffany#4316
@Spunedagr  I get what you are getting at, yet the server will reset any way if we aren't able to keep a good flow of people on, and yes the mobs are hard at first though I personally got better cause of it. I say down grade the frequancy of the mobs if he will be taking away mcmmo cause that is really the only way that we can combat them. However, I had full netherite everything, never said anything about it being too easy, and I still got killed when exploring. Personally for now, I am staying off the server, cause I really don't have anything to do if the server will reset in a few months or weeks.


[25-Oct-20 07:24 PM] Spunedagr#5339
sounds fair


[25-Oct-20 09:32 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
i heard it wont reset until the new update is out


[25-Oct-20 09:32 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
which could be 5-6 months from now


[25-Oct-20 09:33 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
they are on (minecraft (microsoft devs) ) 1.16.4 pre-


[25-Oct-20 09:33 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
which isn't stable enough to run on


[25-Oct-20 09:33 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
^


[25-Oct-20 09:33 PM] RealityGamer04#3868
I agree


[25-Oct-20 09:35 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
management (scrubs server devs ) worked their butt off on the server. not sure they'd be keen on resetting so quickly just because u guys want to go on strike for a server reset


[25-Oct-20 09:37 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
even with a server reset you guys will have the same issue you find a place to build, then get bored again -_- once you have everything done


[25-Oct-20 11:22 PM] Phantom Crypt YT#7913
server might be dead for a week but i ain't giving up dammit! >:D one week left of building
