Suggestions: let your server admin install plugins!


[05-Nov-19 09:22 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Deleted User The reason server admins can’t install plugins is because the server admins would need access to the server log in data. Plus all plugins suggested have to come through me anyway.


[05-Nov-19 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Isn’t it possible to create a secondary login? And I meant OP not “just admins”


[05-Nov-19 09:25 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
It’s possible but again everything has to go through me, some plugins in my eyes seem unnecessary or add features I don’t like. That is a lot of power to give to someone.


[05-Nov-19 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just my 2 cents


[05-Nov-19 10:32 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Oh yea for sure I’ll look into this Pokémon thing haha!

lol you don't have to, it's not pokemon anyways, just catching mobs, could make it easier to farm lol no more lead issues

that 2k is not enough :>


[08-Nov-19 06:35 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Naw we can make it bigger, truth is though no one has griefed in a long time, if they do we can rollback everything they do. I would say just protect your chests but that’s up to you


[08-Nov-19 06:35 PM] amber#2184
naw protecc everything


[08-Nov-19 06:37 PM] SharpZ#1498
Yeah truth is no one griefed in a long time yeah fair enough but Im always on the edge anyways claiming makes myself feel easier lol. but I want to do more spread out projects and I just dont like the thought of people come and go and do something. Also I dont like people stealin mah wheat


[08-Nov-19 06:44 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
Haha well claiming huge massive areas starts to become a problem as well


[08-Nov-19 06:45 PM] SharpZ#1498
yeah of course it should be regulated to not grief with claiming


[08-Nov-19 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Go for chests and mechanisms I would say

Game based roles to cut down on spam . Only CoD can see CoD etc etc


[10-Nov-19 05:42 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
How would you know if someone is here because of cod or Minecraft?


[10-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the discord I help run , we have self assignable roles that people can request and our bot adds them. Then these roles can unlock channels and shit.


[10-Nov-19 05:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
So we can mention people by game / system / etc


[10-Nov-19 05:44 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
I would be down to do something like that


[10-Nov-19 05:47 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Or you could simply make  a bot that uses the cod api, that gives cod channel perms if account is linked


[10-Nov-19 05:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or that, but then what about Minecraft?


[16-Nov-19 10:04 AM] SharpZ#1498
Let other people destroy heads after a certain time. I have like 4 Heads in my base I can't get rid off and they start appearing more and more

Everyone has been asking about a /wild or /random command. I think it would be a cool idea.


[20-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Deleted User 814b545a#4578
Depends how much storage they get with their hoster. Having one them will eat of the space real quick, especially if there's no cooldown to the command


[20-Nov-19 12:49 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
My question is if we had a /wild wouldn’t that area just become no longer wild

We should do a bunker survival next map, everyone starts off above ground and then after a certain date we all have to move into one bunker. There will be many sections and districts in the bunker with a massive amount of auto farms and redstone contraptions. It can be like metro/fallout


[28-Mar-20 10:40 AM] Falconscream#4880
Possibly add more of a roleplay element aswell\

So i just thought bout this the creative part could be a flat world with plots that we can plame a plot with commands and build on that plot but big huge plots not meduim or small ones like ive seen in some servers that way we got room to build lots of stuff


[01-Apr-20 01:51 PM] Sonic21fan#3808
Claim not plame


[01-Apr-20 09:02 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Sonic21fan We played with that idea, and might go with it in the future but the concern was that plots are kind of limiting and flat worlds arent interesting. Currently you will have to get a builder rank from either me, Aj, or Mortex to get access to the server. The only thing we want to know is if you will grief or not. obviously you and many many more will be able to access the server when we get it running.


[02-Apr-20 12:58 AM] Sonic21fan#3808
okay it was just an idea i thought i throw out there and nice i cant wait to see what yall came up with

@daytonagk the reason we didn't make it a plot world is because you can have a lot more creative freedom with natural terrain rather than a plot


[05-May-20 08:43 PM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361

I got an idea for the next server. We need like a storyline. Like a “darkness is approaching on this day” with maybe themes every other day or so leading up to the darkness day. Or like a “3 gods that rule the galaxy, and things happen.” Or like a mission type of society for random events. 

I know it would be a lot of work, but I feel like that could be cool

But yeah, I’d think it would be fun for sure. Might get more people playing after the “I got full diamonds” campaign. Even if the big events are every two/three weeks. Or there’s some big threat that we as players would need to solve.

But I like it


[04-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
It’s actually feedback and ideas! So this is the perfect place to suggest stuff like that!!


[04-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
I know it’s not real, but suggesting maybe a mod pack/plug in with a similar tool is plausible!


[04-Jun-20 12:26 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Sadly can't be done.

That’s modded Minecraft @Kalypso-Santorini


[04-Jun-20 12:28 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
And the point of the channel is more server related


[04-Jun-20 12:30 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Actually, it is possible. I have seen plenty of plugins that have great functions like this. This is definitely related to feedback and ideas


[04-Jun-20 12:32 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
Ooo


[04-Jun-20 12:32 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
U know what it called @ScrubDetector


[04-Jun-20 12:32 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
I kinda want that ngl


[04-Jun-20 12:33 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Not in the specific instance, but we once tried a data pack that you could turn cobble into gravel


[04-Jun-20 12:33 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
with a new tool called a hammer


[04-Jun-20 12:33 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
all done with a data pack


[04-Jun-20 12:33 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
so im sure we could find something


[04-Jun-20 12:36 AM] OnlyAPenguin#3823
That sounds dope


[04-Jun-20 12:36 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
Actually it's 50/50


[04-Jun-20 12:37 AM] Mortex🇬🇧#8361
It requires all user to use a resource pack that will show the correct tool in the form on using it as a plugin


[04-Jun-20 12:37 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
we can force resource packs though

A few suggestions for the server admins:

1: Announce when the servers are going to be down for maintenance half an hour/hour prior to the work starting

2: Make the servers highly available so in case that you have to carry out work on one server, you can use a load balancer/traffic manager to divert the traffic to the server that is still online without completely taking down the network.

[11-Jun-20 01:12 PM] daytonagk#0166
Here’s a good one for the new survival spawn how about having 3x3 doors leading to all the places like one to the outside one to the shop area ect.(if you would like this I don’t mind making them for you


[16-Jun-20 08:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
do we already have a server web?

Any chance subs could get multi-homes again? Loved that feature last time.


[19-Jun-20 11:12 PM] smurphy1996#7802
any chance we can get the mcmmo data pack?


[19-Jun-20 11:12 PM] smurphy1996#7802
i know thats a pretty big one so its not likely but i thought id ask anyways


[19-Jun-20 11:39 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Reyz We just recently took that option away to stop people from tping everywhere, but we might bring it back


[19-Jun-20 11:41 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@smurphy1996 we have had mcmmo on the server previously. What happened was people who really really would grind would get so many extra diamonds. Almost to the point it was game breaking.

Not to say we will never bring it back but that was why we took it away!


[19-Jun-20 11:42 PM] smurphy1996#7802
ah okay lol


[19-Jun-20 11:43 PM] smurphy1996#7802
will there be certain commands for ranks? like nightvision or feed with a cooldown or something like that?


[20-Jun-20 12:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yea there will be a list of commands, most useful /ec for enderchest , /craft to craft on the go ect.


[20-Jun-20 12:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I like the idea of /night vision


[20-Jun-20 12:06 AM] smurphy1996#7802
Nothing too OP but things to help those who choose to support the server lol.


[20-Jun-20 12:37 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
Yes of course!! We also want to add some cosmetic options!


[20-Jun-20 01:08 AM] smurphy1996#7802
like flame trails! lmao


[20-Jun-20 02:17 AM] ScrubDetector#7361

You should add a perk where to ride animals you don’t need saddles like the hack entity ride


[20-Jun-20 10:19 PM] 𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈#5485
Also you can move where animals go like llamas cows etc


[20-Jun-20 10:20 PM] 𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈#5485
Cause transporting animals cows turtles etc are hard


[21-Jun-20 02:00 AM] υѕєяωσℓf#9252
I saw this thing (idk the term or where to find it) but it's called "Single Player Sleeping" or something like that. It basically skips the night if 1 person goes to bed. I don't know about everyone else, but the spawn rate of the mobs at night are *insane* and it would be a nice break to just have 1 person skip to day instead of waiting for 5, 6, or even 7 people to go to bed. I know it probably won't happen, but atleast research a bit about it. It might come in handy! :)


[21-Jun-20 03:20 AM] James#0007
@υѕєяωσℓf We dont have one player sleep as some people want it to be night. And the amount of players required to sleep is a % of the online players. (so more online = more needed to sleep)

if you guys add a shop to buy, you should add slime balls for like $50 or something


[24-Jun-20 07:30 PM] Peax#1311
the server keeps going in easy and normal mode


[25-Jun-20 05:43 AM] smurphy1996#7802
can we add in buyable spawners? nothing too op but like spawners for food? (cows,chickens,sheep,pigs)???


[25-Jun-20 07:30 AM] lujain#8414
Can you change the ores in the shop to ingots


[25-Jun-20 07:53 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
@lujain we cannot, iron farms and gold farms exist, also emeralds are to easy to get


[25-Jun-20 07:59 AM] smurphy1996#7802
scrub what about my idea XD


[25-Jun-20 08:00 AM] smurphy1996#7802
wait nvm


[25-Jun-20 08:00 AM] smurphy1996#7802
we cant because those items are in the shops too


[25-Jun-20 08:00 AM] Kalypso-Santorini#6298
We had silky spawners once, it was... very hectic! It causes quite a bit of lag once a number of people get ahold of those too. And yeah, because you can sell those items if would be a little too OP


[25-Jun-20 08:01 AM] ScrubDetector#7361

it’s a decent idea but I don’t want to have people killing everyone band casing the staff some problems with the complaining


[28-Jun-20 12:30 PM] Peax#1311
Ok then not player head just mob heads


[28-Jun-20 06:06 PM] CommunistBean#8354
yeah  that sounds like a good idea. Having mobs dropping random heads and make them sell for a little extra money which could be used to buy spawners for a VERY expensive price


[28-Jun-20 06:08 PM] KB#8205
You could add more items to be able to sell to the shop so that for example its not just ores that you are able to sell


[28-Jun-20 06:12 PM] CommunistBean#8354
i was thinking maybe ob for a little less than you would think just so the money isnt rng


[29-Jun-20 08:19 AM] nuggie#7574
all very good ideas but atm the devs are working on something else but they will take your ideas into consideration


[01-Jul-20 04:14 PM] 𝕋𝕠𝕒𝕤𝕥␈#5485
Heads have been a problem because last season everyone wanted each others heads and were selling them for items it’s kinda boring and breaks the economy

So, idea for the player shops (or even for if you wanted to sell mending books or so), what if there was a teleport like /shops where players could own a plot and sell items? Similar to how the prison homes worked on the old server? Would allow for more stuff at spawn or so

I HAVE AN IDEA so you know that there is a sub rank well there is no perks and i thought of one and there can only be one


[06-Jul-20 05:53 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
have 2 set homes


[06-Jul-20 05:57 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
or a perm potion effect your choice (eg /perks and you chose what to claim and you cant switch after) so if you pick 2 set homes you can set one in your bace and one in like a farm or the end or you chose the potion you could have 3 to pick and you cant swap after so there will be fire res, haste or swiftness.


[06-Jul-20 05:58 PM] LIKLIKLIK15#0411
and an extra perm for the vip a kit for towny where ever week they get to swap to what ever they want all over again if they want to

(the vip is the same as the 2 set home or potion affect but they can swap ever week if they want to)

not make dias more rare on the hardcore server bc u cant sell them anyays


[07-Jul-20 03:22 AM] James#0007
It’s in the title hard


[07-Jul-20 04:10 AM] ScrubDetector#7361
I think that a permanent potion effect would be broken. Also I don’t like having multiple set homes because players start to teleport all over the place, with zero penalties.

Subs do have access to commands like /ec /craft


[07-Jul-20 10:51 AM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
@ScrubDetector tbh I'm gonna have to disagree with you, homes are more of a convenience than a cheat, it basically just removes time wasted from travel


[07-Jul-20 12:00 PM] smurphy1996#7802
and also removes the need for food because you arent traveling as much, therefore its an inconvenient, just my opinion though. everyone is allowed to have one 🙂


[07-Jul-20 01:00 PM] ScrubDetector#7361
@Don’t Censor Hentai I never said it was a cheat, but it takes many game mechanics and throws them out the window. Nether travel, horses, boats, elytra travel, rail carts.


[07-Jul-20 01:16 PM] Don’t Censor Hentai#4854
true, but that doesn't mean these mechanics are good mechanics, it's extremely boring to travel once you've done it a thousand times and it takes alot of time and homes remove that annoyance, but I get how ya feel.


[07-Jul-20 05:43 PM] flockthebird#7395
there is a bug in the uhc, auto sugarcane farm does not work. thank you for the help-flockthebird


[08-Jul-20 01:49 PM] Nia#6083
1.16 has prevented 0 tick farms @flockthebird  if that’s what you mean


[08-Jul-20 01:50 PM] flockthebird#7395
No its the oldfashion observer one


[08-Jul-20 01:52 PM] Nia#6083
Hmmm I would make sure that you read up on 1.16 because it did change some red stone mechanics as well. I would also YouTube a 1.16 tutorial and if that doesn’t work, I’ll check it out when I get on later -unless someone beats me to it.

Pistons dont push/break blocks if they aren't in a claim that you own / have access too

Add a stream role that is self assignable and will ping you every time scrub streams


[17-Jul-20 09:28 AM] CommunistBean#8354
Make a spawner shop for really expensive spawners like a zombie and skeleton spawner so people can have a mobfarm of their own near their base without planning ahead on where to put ur base


[17-Jul-20 09:29 AM] CommunistBean#8354
Not like irongolem or any spawners from like skyblock servers but like 2-3 spawners like skeleton zombie and spider spawners just for easy exp farms


[17-Jul-20 10:00 AM] Poinda#0220
that would break the mob drops


[27-Jul-20 09:35 AM] CommunistBean#8354
but then everyone should be on at the same time


[27-Jul-20 09:35 AM] CommunistBean#8354
or else they wont get banned


[27-Jul-20 09:35 AM] CommunistBean#8354
for the 3 days


[27-Jul-20 09:39 AM] CommunistBean#8354
and also people would just not join squads and work like a "team" without the "team" aspect


[27-Jul-20 09:39 AM] CommunistBean#8354

I would like to make a feedback on the ticket i opened.
Feedback: ***1 out of 5 stars***, since I was not getting help on my ticket nor was I answered concerning my questions. (Mod answering me on the ticket: AsianNerd)
Feedback: ***1 out of 5 stars***


[22-Aug-20 03:27 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
Also, I do not understand why it is that mods and above ranks that play survival with the community should be able to use non-community perms to receive their items again if they die.
*Example that just happened: I was mining down a hole to find ores and start mining at y12, when AsianNerd a MOD fell down the hole while he was in survival meaning he died and lost his stuff. AsianNerd then teleported to me since i was in the hole when he died and he went to take his stuff.*

Its feedback thread


[22-Aug-20 03:52 PM] Timotainment#4596
dr doof on ur ticket i told u the reason why u had to unclaim ur base. It was not me who banned u so I could not answer the questions but seeing as u have been unbanned there was no point in opening the ticket


[22-Aug-20 03:52 PM] Timotainment#4596
secondly, i wanted to see why u made a big hole near spawn


[22-Aug-20 03:52 PM] Timotainment#4596
so i got on some useless stuff


[22-Aug-20 03:53 PM] Timotainment#4596
someone told me u had alts and set traps around spawn


[22-Aug-20 03:53 PM] Timotainment#4596
might as well try and wear some trash stuff and see whats up


[22-Aug-20 03:53 PM] Timotainment#4596
after i used gmsp to see the bottom of it and saw nothing butu just digging so I got the trash stuff and went on my way


[22-Aug-20 04:00 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
There should be something like /kit claim to get a goldenshovel


[22-Aug-20 04:11 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
or just a command like /shovel to  get goldenshovel


[22-Aug-20 04:17 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
> secondly, i wanted to see why u made a big hole near spawn
@Timotainment That hole was 3 blocks deep and was like 200 blocks from spawn


[22-Aug-20 04:19 PM] Timotainment#4596
actually it was about 30 blocks away and almost down to y-=11


[22-Aug-20 04:19 PM] Timotainment#4596
ill come onliner


[22-Aug-20 04:19 PM] Timotainment#4596
rq


[22-Aug-20 04:20 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
Even if it was "30" away from spawn, it was only 3 blocks meaning the hole was not "BIG"


[22-Aug-20 04:21 PM] Timotainment#4596
yes but it still coudlve been a hazard and someone told me u made traps so i was curious


[22-Aug-20 04:21 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
traps?


[22-Aug-20 04:21 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
and why would i do that


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Timotainment#4596
idk but u did place a shit ton of redstone and shit one day


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
Did u check that it was me?


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Timotainment#4596
yes


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Timotainment#4596
it said u placed it


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
The only time i would do that was the time i made a wall around spawn


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
not trapping it


[22-Aug-20 04:22 PM] Timotainment#4596
nono u also placed redstone blocks, repeaters, a giant tower of iron too


[22-Aug-20 04:23 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
what?


[22-Aug-20 04:23 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
no i didnt? and if so it was the wall


[22-Aug-20 04:23 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
how is that redstone a trap


[22-Aug-20 04:24 PM] Timotainment#4596
not a trap but on that day someone told beach that u said there were traps ot smthing, idk  i think it was youssefe, vons pajus or someone else,


[22-Aug-20 04:24 PM] Timotainment#4596
anyways thats all i know or heard so yea


[22-Aug-20 04:24 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
But you said that i placed traps


[22-Aug-20 04:24 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
in the start of the convo


[22-Aug-20 04:24 PM] Timotainment#4596
yes


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
so that was a lie?


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Timotainment#4596
thats what i heard anyways


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
Oh ok


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Timotainment#4596
sorry


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Timotainment#4596
just letting u know my sus


[22-Aug-20 04:25 PM] Timotainment#4596
and try not to dig huge holes down at spawn cus it just makes the server spawn look bad


[22-Aug-20 04:26 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
How do i go mining then


[22-Aug-20 04:26 PM] Timotainment#4596
um not huge straight holes near spawn ig


[22-Aug-20 04:26 PM] Timotainment#4596
do it somewhat farther


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
Is there a limit


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
like how far do u want it?


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Timotainment#4596
nah


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Timotainment#4596
just not very open


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Timotainment#4596
or u can cover it up


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
So just 30 blocks away?


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Dr. Doof#9988
thats fine?


[22-Aug-20 04:27 PM] Timotainment#4596
nono just cover the hole up after ig


[22-Aug-20 04:28 PM] Dr. Doof#9988

just an idea, can we make all mobs a little more extreme

like creepers are all extremely strong, skeleton bows are enchanted, zombies can run fastewr and spawn with weapons

Oops- Well, I think it'd be nice if players could have access or be able to request a nickname (I.e I would like my nick on mc to be Cryptican to match my discord name). Maybe with like a book and quill to drop in a hopper chest at spawn so staff could go over when they felt like it?

Things that need to be fixed:

- Sub/VIP perms. I've noticed no access to /craft so far, and if I see anything else I'll let you know.

- Shop perms. No one has access to the farmer/miner shops, even if you re-buy the roles. This goes for the NPC villagers at spawn and also in the /help menu.

If I find anything else I'll add it to the list 🙂
